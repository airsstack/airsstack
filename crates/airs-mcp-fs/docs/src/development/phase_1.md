# Phase 1: Foundation & Core Operations (Weeks 1-3)

## **Objective**: Establish bulletproof filesystem foundation with basic security

## **Strategic Focus**
Build the essential infrastructure that will support all advanced features while establishing security-first patterns from day one. This phase creates the foundation that determines project success.

## **Week 1: Project Foundation & MCP Integration**

### **Sprint 1.1: Project Structure & Dependencies**
**Deliverables**:
- Complete AIRS MCP-FS crate setup within workspace architecture
- Cargo.toml configuration with all necessary dependencies
- Integration with existing AIRS MCP foundation
- Build system validation and CI/CD pipeline setup

**Key Milestones**:
- Project compiles without warnings using AIRS workspace patterns
- All foundational dependencies resolved and tested
- Integration tests with AIRS MCP infrastructure passing
- Development environment fully operational

### **Sprint 1.2: MCP Server Foundation**
**Deliverables**:
- Basic MCP server implementation using STDIO transport
- JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling for filesystem operations
- Tool registration framework for file operations
- Initial Claude Desktop integration validation

**Key Milestones**:
- MCP server successfully connects to Claude Desktop
- Basic tool discovery and registration working
- Message routing and response handling operational
- Protocol compliance validated against MCP specification

## **Week 2: Core File Operations**

### **Sprint 2.1: Essential File Tools**
**Deliverables**:
- read_file tool with encoding detection and validation
- write_file tool with basic approval workflow
- list_directory tool with metadata extraction
- Error handling framework for all file operations

**Key Milestones**:
- All core file operations functional through Claude Desktop
- Text file reading and writing working reliably
- Directory listing with file metadata displayed correctly
- Error conditions handled gracefully with user-friendly messages

### **Sprint 2.2: Directory Management**
**Deliverables**:
- create_directory tool with recursive creation support
- delete_file and delete_directory tools with safety checks
- move_file and copy_file tools for file manipulation
- Path validation and canonicalization system

**Key Milestones**:
- Complete directory management functionality
- File manipulation operations working safely
- Path traversal attacks prevented through validation
- Atomic operations ensuring file system consistency

## **Week 3: Security Framework Implementation**

### **Sprint 3.1: Human-in-the-Loop Approval System**
**Deliverables**:
- Interactive approval workflow for write operations
- Terminal-based approval interface with clear operation details
- Approval decision logging and audit trail
- Configurable approval policies for different operation types

**Key Milestones**:
- Write operations require and receive human approval
- Approval interface provides clear, actionable information
- Approval decisions properly logged for audit purposes
- Different operation types handled with appropriate approval levels

### **Sprint 3.2: Access Control & Path Security**
**Deliverables**:
- Configuration-driven security policies
- Path allowlist and denylist enforcement
- Forbidden file pattern detection and blocking
- Security policy validation and testing framework

**Key Milestones**:
- Access control policies enforced consistently
- Forbidden files and patterns properly blocked
- Security configuration loaded from hierarchical sources
- Security violations logged and reported appropriately

## **Phase 1 Validation Criteria**
- ✅ All core filesystem operations working through Claude Desktop
- ✅ Security framework preventing unauthorized access
- ✅ Human approval workflow functioning correctly
- ✅ Error handling providing helpful, actionable feedback
- ✅ Performance targets met for basic file operations (<100ms)
