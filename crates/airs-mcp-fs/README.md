### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.88.0 or later
- Claude Desktop or another MCP-compatible client

### Installation

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rstlix0x0/airs.git
cd airs
cargo build --release --bin airs-mcp-fs
```

#### Using Cargo
```bash
cargo install --path crates/airs-mcp-fs
```

### Basic Setup

**Step 1: Generate Configuration**
```bash
# Generate development configuration
airs-mcp-fs generate-config

# This creates ~/.config/airs-mcp-fs/development.toml
```

**Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop**

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "airs-mcp-fs": {
      "command": "/path/to/airs-mcp-fs",
      "env": {
        "AIRS_MCP_FS_ENV": "development",
        "AIRS_MCP_FS_CONFIG_DIR": "/Users/yourusername/.config/airs-mcp-fs",
        "AIRS_MCP_FS_LOG_DIR": "/Users/yourusername/.local/share/airs-mcp-fs/logs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/path/to/airs-mcp-fs` with the actual path to your binary and `yourusername` with your actual username.

**Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop**

Restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server configuration.

### Test Your Setup

Once Claude Desktop restarts, try these commands:

```
User: "List the files in my Documents directory"
Claude: *uses list_directory tool* ‚Üí shows your Documents contents

User: "Read my project's README.md file"
Claude: *uses read_file tool* ‚Üí displays the README content

User: "Create a new file called hello.txt with 'Hello World' in my Documents"
Claude: *uses write_file tool* ‚Üí creates the file with approval prompt
```

## Core Capabilities

### File Operations
- **read_file**: Read text files with automatic encoding detection
- **write_file**: Create or update files with approval workflows
- **list_directory**: Browse filesystem with metadata and filtering
- **create_directory**: Create directory structures recursively
- **delete_file/delete_directory**: Safe deletion with confirmation
- **move_file/copy_file**: File manipulation with atomic operations

### Security Features
- **Binary File Restriction**: Comprehensive blocking of binary files to eliminate binary-based security risks
- **Human Approval**: Interactive confirmation for write/delete operations
- **Path Validation**: Prevent directory traversal and unauthorized access
- **Access Control**: Configurable allowlists and denylists for file paths
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive operation tracking for compliance
- **Threat Detection**: Enhanced security monitoring with binary file rejection

## Configuration

AIRS MCP-FS uses a sophisticated multi-layered configuration system that automatically adapts to different environments while maintaining security and flexibility.

### Quick Configuration

For development work, your configuration should include your project directories:

```toml
# ~/.config/airs-mcp-fs/development.toml
[security.filesystem]
allowed_paths = [
    "~/projects/**/*",           # All your projects
    "~/Documents/**/*",          # Documents directory (both directory and contents)
    "~/Desktop/**/*",            # Desktop files
    "./**/*"                     # Current directory when running from project
]

[security.operations]
read_allowed = true
write_requires_policy = false    # Allow writes in development
delete_requires_explicit_allow = true

# Named policies for different file types
[security.policies.journal_files]
patterns = ["/Users/yourusername/Documents/**/*"]
operations = ["read", "write", "list"]
risk_level = "low"
description = "Personal journal and document files"
```

**Important**: When configuring directory access, you need both the directory path itself AND its contents:
- `~/Documents` - Access to the directory itself
- `~/Documents/**/*` - Access to files within the directory

### Environment-Specific Configuration

AIRS MCP-FS automatically detects your environment and loads appropriate configurations:

- **Development**: `~/.config/airs-mcp-fs/development.toml` - Permissive settings for productivity
- **Staging**: `~/.config/airs-mcp-fs/staging.toml` - Production-like settings for testing  
- **Production**: `~/.config/airs-mcp-fs/production.toml` - Secure settings for deployment

## Security Best Practices

### Recommended Security Settings
- Always enable approval workflows for write operations
- Use restrictive path allowlists for sensitive environments
- Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
- Keep forbidden patterns updated with sensitive file types
- Binary file processing is disabled by default for maximum security

### Path Security
- Use absolute paths in configuration when possible
- Avoid wildcard patterns that might expose sensitive directories
- Regularly audit allowed paths and remove unnecessary access
- Monitor for path traversal attempts in logs

### Binary File Security
- Binary file processing is completely disabled for enhanced security
- All binary file operations return security validation errors
- Focus on text-based file operations for AI-assisted development
- Eliminates entire classes of binary-based security vulnerabilities
- Provides clear security boundaries for enterprise deployments

## Advanced Features

### Security-First Architecture
The system prioritizes security through comprehensive binary file restriction and enhanced validation:

```toml
[security]
# Binary processing is completely disabled for security
binary_processing_disabled = true
text_only_mode = true
```

### Plugin System
Extend functionality with custom text file processors:
- Register custom text format handlers
- Add domain-specific processing logic for development files
- Integrate with external tools and services for text processing
- Create organization-specific workflows for code and documentation

### AIRS Ecosystem Integration
- **airs-mcp**: Leverage shared MCP infrastructure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Permission Denied" Errors
- **Cause**: Path not included in `allowed_paths` configuration or blocked by `denied_paths`
- **Solution**: Update your configuration to include the required directory and its contents:
  ```toml
  [security.filesystem]
  allowed_paths = [
      "~/Documents",        # Directory itself
      "~/Documents/**/*"    # Directory contents
  ]
  ```

#### "Security validation failed" Errors  
- **Cause**: Glob patterns not matching the requested path
- **Solution**: Ensure your patterns include both directory access and content access
- **Debug**: Check your configuration file and verify the path patterns

#### "Configuration file not found" Warnings
- **Cause**: No environment-specific configuration file exists
- **Solution**: Generate configuration for your environment:
  ```bash
  airs-mcp-fs generate-config --env development
  ```

#### "Invalid server response" in Claude Desktop
- **Cause**: Incorrect environment variables or binary path in Claude Desktop configuration
- **Solution**: Verify your Claude Desktop JSON configuration includes correct paths and environment variables
