# Day 2: Memory Bank Parser Implementation

**Objective: Implement robust memory bank structure parsing**

## Task 2.1: Data Model Definition

- Define complete Rust data structures for memory bank components
- Implement serialization/deserialization with serde
- Create workspace and sub-project context structures
- Add task management data models

**Deliverables:**

- Complete data model hierarchy matching memory bank specification
- Proper serde annotations for parsing
- Type-safe representation of all memory bank components

## Task 2.2: File System Navigation

- Implement memory bank directory structure discovery
- Add file existence checking and validation
- Create path resolution for workspace and sub-project files
- Handle missing files gracefully with default structures

**Deliverables:**

- Robust file system navigation for memory bank structures
- Graceful handling of missing or incomplete structures
- Path resolution for all memory bank component types

## Task 2.3: Markdown Parser Implementation

- Implement markdown content parsing for memory bank files
- Extract structured information from content sections
- Handle YAML frontmatter if present
- Parse task lists and status information

**Deliverables:**

- Working markdown parser for all memory bank file types
- Content extraction from structured sections
- Task status and progress parsing

## Task 2.4: Context Correlation System

- Implement current context tracking (current_context.md)
- Add workspace-to-project relationship mapping
- Create context switching logic
- Handle multi-project context resolution

**Deliverables:**

- Current context detection and tracking
- Workspace and project context correlation
- Multi-project relationship understanding

## Day 2 Success Criteria

- ✅ Parser correctly reads existing AIRS memory bank structure
- ✅ All memory bank file types parse without errors
- ✅ Missing files handled gracefully with helpful messages
- ✅ Context relationships properly understood and represented
