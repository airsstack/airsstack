# Integration Strategy

## GitHub Copilot Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup

- Install Instructions: airs-memspec install --path .copilot
- Configure Copilot: Apply custom instructions to GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- Initialize Memory Bank: Chat with Copilot to create memory bank structure

### Phase 2: Development

- Context Awareness: Copilot automatically reads memory bank for project understanding
- State Monitoring: Use airs-memspec commands for quick state overview
- AI Collaboration: Natural conversation with Copilot for memory bank updates
- Context Switching: Copilot maintains awareness across sub-projects

### Phase 3: Maintenance

- State Validation: Regular checks using airs-memspec status
- Context Updates: Copilot maintains memory bank through development
- Project Evolution: Memory bank grows with project complexity
- Historical Tracking: Context snapshots preserve development history
