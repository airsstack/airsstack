# AIRS MCP: Technical Project Overview

## Project Definition

`AIRS MCP` is a **production-ready** Rust implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides both server and client libraries for integrating AI applications with external systems. The project delivers type-safe, high-performance MCP implementations with comprehensive protocol compliance and security features.

> **Status: Production Ready** ✅  
> Complete implementation with 345+ passing tests, full Claude Desktop integration, and 8.5+ GiB/s performance benchmarks.

## Technical Problem Statement

### Core Challenge: Protocol Implementation Complexity

MCP presents several non-trivial implementation challenges:

- Bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0: Unlike typical request-response APIs, MCP requires servers to initiate requests to clients
- Stateful Protocol Lifecycle: Three-phase connection management (initialization → operation → shutdown) with strict message filtering
- Capability Negotiation: Dynamic feature availability based on runtime capability exchange
- Security Requirements: OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for HTTP, human-in-the-loop approval workflows, comprehensive audit logging
- Real-time Features: Resource subscriptions, progress tracking, cancellation support

## Implementation Requirements

```
Protocol Compliance:
├── JSON-RPC 2.0 foundation with MCP extensions
├── Bidirectional communication (client ↔ server requests)
├── Three-phase lifecycle management
├── Capability-based feature negotiation
└── Transport abstraction (STDIO + HTTP)

Server Features:
├── Resources (URI templates, subscriptions, pagination)
├── Tools (JSON Schema validation, safety controls, approval workflows)
├── Prompts (templates, completion, multi-modal support)
└── Real-time updates (subscriptions, notifications)

Client Features:
├── Server connection management
├── Sampling (server-initiated AI requests with double approval)
├── Root directory access capability
└── Multi-server coordination

Security & Quality:
├── OAuth 2.1 + PKCE authentication
├── Human-in-the-loop approval workflows
├── Comprehensive audit logging
└── Production-grade error handling and recovery
```
