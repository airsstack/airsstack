# Implementation Complexity Analysis

## High-Complexity Areas

### Bidirectional Request Correlation

- Challenge: Concurrent request streams in both directions with proper ID management
- Solution: Partitioned ID spaces + async request correlation with timeout handling

### Protocol State Machine Enforcement

- Challenge: Prevent invalid messages based on connection phase and capabilities
- Solution: Type-safe state machine with compile-time constraint checking where possible

### OAuth 2.1 + PKCE Implementation

- Challenge: Standards-compliant authentication with security best practices
- Solution: Dedicated OAuth module with comprehensive security testing

### Human-in-the-Loop Approval Workflows

- Challenge: Secure, user-friendly approval for sensitive operations
- Solution: Pluggable approval system with risk-based escalation
