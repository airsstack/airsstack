tokio-stream = { version = "0.1", features = ["sync"] }
futures = "0.3"
# Decision: Advanced async streaming and future utilities
# Implementation: Used in streaming, concurrent operations, and HTTP transport

# === Serialization Stack ===
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
serde_urlencoded = "0.7"
serde_yml = { version = "0.0.12" }

# Implementation: Complete error system across all modules
# Quality: Comprehensive error types with context preservation

# === Core Utilities ===
uuid = { version = "1.18", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
# Decision: UUID generation for request correlation IDs and session management
# Implementation: Unique ID generation across distributed systems

bytes = "1.5"
# Decision: Zero-copy buffer management for high performance
# Implementation: Efficient message processing and transport layer

tokio-util = { version = "0.7", features = ["codec"] }
# Decision: Tokio utilities for streaming and codec operations
# Implementation: Transport layer streaming capabilities

tracing = "0.1"
# Decision: Structured logging for observability
# Implementation: Production logging throughout all components

async-trait = "0.1.88"
# Decision: Trait-based async patterns for clean architecture
# Implementation: ResourceProvider, ToolProvider, PromptProvider traits

chrono = { version = "~0.4", features = ["serde"] }
# Decision: Time management with UTC timestamps
# Implementation: Workspace standard for all time operations

# === HTTP Server & Middleware (PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTED) ===
axum = { version = "0.8.4", features = ["ws"] }
hyper = { version = "1.6.0", features = ["full"] }
tower = { version = "0.5", features = ["full"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.6", features = ["cors", "trace"] }
# Decision: Production HTTP server stack with WebSocket support
# Implementation: Complete Axum-based MCP HTTP server with middleware
# Features: CORS, tracing, WebSocket upgrade capabilities

reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json"] }
# Decision: HTTP client for OAuth2 and external service integration
# Implementation: JWT validation, OAuth2 token introspection

deadpool = { version = "0.12" }
# Decision: Connection pooling for HTTP transport
# Implementation: Session management and connection lifecycle

# === OAuth2 Authentication System (PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTED) ===
jsonwebtoken = { version = "9.3" }
oauth2 = { version = "4.4" }
base64 = { version = "0.22" }
url = { version = "2.5" }
# Decision: Complete OAuth2 2.1 + PKCE authentication system
# Implementation: JWT validation, JWKS client, scope validation
# Features: Token lifecycle, refresh, caching, middleware integration

# === Advanced Features (PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTED) ===
regex = { version = "1.11.1" }
# Decision: Pattern matching for security policies and validation
# Implementation: Path validation, scope matching, URL patterns

urlencoding = { version = "2.1" }
# Decision: URL encoding for HTTP authentication and security
# Implementation: OAuth2 flows, HTTP parameter encoding
```

## Feature Flag Strategy (No Features Implemented)

```toml
# No feature flags defined - all functionality included by default
# The crate does not use optional features or conditional compilation
```

## MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) - Production

```toml
// Cargo.toml (actual)
rust-version = "1.70"

// Production MSRV rationale:
// - Stable tokio async patterns support
// - Mature serde ecosystem compatibility  
// - Proven compiler stability for production use
// - Comprehensive standard library features
```

## All Dependencies Are Implemented

**Current Status**: All dependencies listed above are fully implemented and integrated:

- **OAuth 2.1 Authentication**: Fully implemented with `oauth2`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `base64` dependencies
- **HTTP Transport**: Production-ready with `axum`, `hyper`, `reqwest`, and related HTTP stack
- **STDIO Transport**: Production-ready and Claude Desktop compatible
- **Security**: All security features are implemented and production-ready

**No Optional Dependencies**: The crate includes all functionality by default without feature flags.
