# STDIO MCP Integration Test Dependencies
# 
# These are minimal dependencies since STDIO tests use subprocess communication
# rather than HTTP requests like the OAuth2 integration tests.

# Note: STDIO tests only need core Python libraries (json, subprocess, sys, os)
# which are part of the standard library. No external dependencies required.

# Optional: For enhanced test output formatting
colorama==0.4.6

# Optional: For test timing and performance analysis  
psutil==5.9.6
