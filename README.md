# AIRS (AI & Rust)

A personal AI technology stack built entirely in Rust, designed as a foundational framework for AI engineering tools and software.

## Overview

AIRS follows a Cargo Workspace structure to organize multiple related packages and tools for AI development. The project emphasizes type safety, performance, and clean architecture for building AI-powered applications.

## Project Philosophy

- **AI-Assisted Implementation**: Architecture decisions made by humans, implementation generated by AI
- **Rust-First Approach**: Leveraging Rust's performance and safety for AI infrastructure  
- **Personal Foundation**: Built primarily for personal use with potential for broader application

## Workspace Members

- **airs-mcp**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation *(in development)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.88.0 or later
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)

This project requires Rust 1.84.0 or later. We generally track the latest stable Rust release.

## Development

This project uses a Cargo Workspace structure. Each workspace member is located in the `crates/` directory and can be developed independently while sharing common configuration and dependencies.

### Adding New Members

1. Create a new directory under `crates/`
2. Add the member to the `members` array in the root `Cargo.toml`
3. Follow the established patterns for consistency

## Planned Features

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementations
- CLI tools for AI workflows
- API integrations (Notion, Slack, etc.)
- Python bindings for broader ecosystem compatibility
- AI agent development framework
