## 🎯 Our Vision

"Empower everyone to build their own AI-powered applications and agents"

We provide the essential open-source components that enable individuals, teams, and organizations to create sophisticated AI systems tailored to their specific needs - from simple productivity tools to complex autonomous agents.

## 🧭 Core Philosophy

• 🤝 **Human-AI Collaboration**: Human-driven architecture with AI-accelerated implementation  
• 🏠 **AI Sovereignty**: More ownership and control of your AI infrastructure  
• 🔓 **Open Source First**: Apache/MIT licensing ensuring freedom and flexibility  
• 🛡️ **Privacy by Design**: Keep more of your data under your control  
• 🔧 **Composable Components**: Building blocks, not black boxes  
• ⚡ **Performance Focused**: Rust-first with support for multiple technology stacks

## 🔄 Meta-Philosophy: AI Tools Built by AI

We practice what we preach - our AI infrastructure components are themselves built using AI-assisted methodologies. This creates a powerful recursive approach:

**🧠 Human-AI Collaboration**
• Strategic architecture designed by humans  
• Implementation accelerated by AI  
• Continuous validation through both perspectives  

**🔁 Self-Improving Process**
• AI tools become better by being built with AI assistance  
• Real-world experience informs better AI development tools  
• Methodology becomes part of what we offer the community  

**✨ Authentic Understanding**  
We deeply understand AI development challenges because we use AI to build AI tools. Our components solve real problems we've encountered in our own AI-assisted development.

## 💡 Why AirsStack?

🔒 **More Control, Less Vendor Lock-in**  
Building personal AI infrastructure is challenging, but AirsStack makes it more accessible. Reduce dependence on external AI services and gain more control over your data and workflows.

🛠️ **Developer-First**  
Composable components, not black boxes. Use what you need, extend what you want, control what matters to you.

## AI-Assisted Development & Memory-Bank Management

AirsStack embodies our philosophy of AI tools built by AI. We leverage a sophisticated memory-bank management system to ensure resilient, transparent, and context-driven development that serves as both a development methodology and a reusable component for the community.

### Memory-Bank System Overview
- **Workspace-Level Context**: Shared files define overall vision, architecture, and standards across all components
- **Component Memory Banks**: Each component maintains its own requirements, design, technical context, and progress tracking
- **Task Management**: Detailed tracking with status, subtasks, and progress logs for precise project management
- **Context Snapshots**: Operational state preservation for onboarding, recovery, and historical analysis

### Human-AI Collaboration Model
- **Strategic Human Control**: Architectural decisions and strategic direction remain human-driven
- **AI-Accelerated Implementation**: Code generation, documentation, and routine tasks enhanced by AI
- **Transparent Process**: Every action, decision, and change logged for complete audit trail
- **Specification-Driven**: Rigorous workflow ensuring clear requirements, validated designs, and thorough testing
- **Community Contribution**: Our methodology becomes part of what we offer to the community

### Practical Usage for Teams
1. **Context Preservation**: Maintain development state across team members and AI collaborators
2. **Onboarding Acceleration**: New team members can rapidly understand project state and history
3. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive tracking ensures nothing falls through the cracks
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Explicit documentation of decisions and reasoning for long-term maintainability
5. **Switch Contexts**: For multi-project workspaces, update the active sub-project and re-read all relevant files before proceeding.

For more details, see `.copilot/memory_bank/` and the documentation in `docs/`.

4. **Documentation**: Crate-level and workspace-level documentation
5. **AI-Assisted Coding**: Leverage `.copilot/` configurations for consistent development

### Adding New Workspace Members
```bash
# Create new crate
cargo new --lib crates/new-crate-name

# Add to workspace Cargo.toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "crates/airs-mcp",
    "crates/airs-memspec", 
    "crates/new-crate-name",  # Add here
]
```

### Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: Individual feature development
- **Crate-Specific**: Features can be developed per crate independently

## Coding Standards

### Rust Best Practices
- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` for consistent code formatting
- **Linting**: Address all `cargo clippy` warnings
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc comments for public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Proper `Result` and `Option` usage
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership system effectively

### Project Conventions
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names following Rust conventions
- **Modules**: Organize code into logical modules and sub-modules
- **Visibility**: Minimize public API surface, expose only necessary items
- **Dependencies**: Prefer minimal, well-maintained crates
- **Testing**: Unit tests alongside code, integration tests in `tests/` directory

## Testing

### Testing Framework
- **Unit Tests**: In-module tests using `#[cfg(test)]`
- **Integration Tests**: Separate `tests/` directory for each crate
- **Documentation Tests**: Embedded examples in rustdoc comments
- **Workspace Testing**: `cargo test --workspace` for comprehensive testing

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Test specific crate
cargo test -p airs-mcp

# Test with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Test specific example
cd crates/airs-mcp/examples/simple-mcp-client
cargo test
```

### Coverage and Quality
- Aim for comprehensive test coverage of public APIs
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use property-based testing where appropriate
- Benchmark performance-critical code
