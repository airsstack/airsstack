â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml              # Workspace configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ crates/                 # Individual workspace members
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ airs-mcp/          # Model Context Protocol implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ airs-memspec/      # Memory bank specification and tooling
â”œâ”€â”€ .copilot/              # AI-assisted development configuration

### Design Principles
- **Human Architecture, AI Implementation**: Strategic decisions made by humans, code generated with AI assistance
- **Rust-First Approach**: Leveraging Rust's memory safety and performance for AI infrastructure
- **Modular Design**: Each crate serves a specific purpose in the AI ecosystem
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for reliable AI tool development

## AI Collaboration & Memory-Bank Management

This project leverages a robust memory-bank management system to ensure resilient, transparent, and context-driven development. The memory bank is a structured set of Markdown files that track requirements, architecture, technical decisions, implementation plans, and progress for every sub-project and the workspace as a whole.

### Memory-Bank System Overview
- **Workspace-Level Context**: Shared files define the overall vision, architecture, and standards for all sub-projects.
- **Sub-Project Memory Bank**: Each sub-project maintains its own set of files for requirements, design, tech context, active decisions, and progress.
- **Task Management**: Every development task is tracked in detail, with status, subtasks, and progress logs, enabling precise project management and onboarding.
- **Context Snapshots**: Operational state can be saved and restored at any time, supporting historical analysis and rapid recovery from context loss.

### Human/AI Collaboration
- **Human Architecture, AI Implementation**: Strategic decisions are made by humans, while code and documentation are generated and maintained with AI assistance.
- **AI Agent Workflow**: The AI agent operates autonomously, executing tasks, updating documentation, and managing context without requiring confirmation or permission.
- **Specification-Driven Execution**: All work follows a rigorous, specification-driven workflow, ensuring requirements are clear, designs are validated, and implementations are thoroughly documented and tested.
- **Transparency & Traceability**: Every action, decision, and change is logged in the memory bank, providing a complete audit trail of human/AI collaboration.

### How to Use the Memory Bank
1. **Review Context**: Start every session by reading all relevant memory bank files for the workspace and active sub-project.
2. **Track Tasks**: Use the tasks index and individual task files to monitor progress, update statuses, and document decisions.
3. **Update Documentation**: After every significant change, update the memory bank to reflect the current state and next steps.
4. **Save Context Snapshots**: Use context snapshots to preserve operational state for onboarding, recovery, or historical analysis.
5. **Switch Contexts**: For multi-project workspaces, update the active sub-project and re-read all relevant files before proceeding.

For more details, see `.copilot/memory_bank/` and the documentation in `docs/`.

# Add to workspace Cargo.toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "crates/airs-mcp",
    "crates/airs-memspec", 
    "crates/new-crate-name",  # Add here
]
```

### Branch Strategy

- **Feature Branches**: Individual feature development
- **Crate-Specific**: Features can be developed per crate independently

## Coding Standards

### Rust Best Practices
- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` for consistent code formatting
- **Linting**: Address all `cargo clippy` warnings
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc comments for public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Proper `Result` and `Option` usage
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership system effectively

### Project Conventions
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names following Rust conventions
- **Modules**: Organize code into logical modules and sub-modules
- **Visibility**: Minimize public API surface, expose only necessary items
- **Dependencies**: Prefer minimal, well-maintained crates
- **Testing**: Unit tests alongside code, integration tests in `tests/` directory

## Testing

### Testing Framework
- **Unit Tests**: In-module tests using `#[cfg(test)]`
- **Integration Tests**: Separate `tests/` directory for each crate
- **Documentation Tests**: Embedded examples in rustdoc comments
- **Workspace Testing**: `cargo test --workspace` for comprehensive testing

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Test specific crate
cargo test -p airs-mcp

# Test with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Test specific example
cd crates/airs-mcp/examples/simple-mcp-client
cargo test
```

### Coverage and Quality
