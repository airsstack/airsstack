# task_003 - Core File Operations

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-25  
**Completed:** 2025-08-25

## Original Request
Implement the three fundamental filesystem operation tools: read_file (with encoding detection and security validation), write_file (with human approval workflow), and list_directory (with metadata and filtering capabilities).

## Thought Process
This task implements the core value proposition of airs-mcp-fs - enabling AI agents to interact with local filesystems through standardized, secure operations. The three tools represent the foundation of all filesystem interactions:

1. **read_file**: Must handle text and binary files with automatic encoding detection, security validation, and size limits. This enables AI to understand project context and file content.

2. **write_file**: Critical tool that requires human approval workflow integration. Must support file creation and modification with proper security checks and audit logging.

3. **list_directory**: Enables AI to understand project structure and navigate filesystem hierarchies. Requires metadata extraction and filtering capabilities.

Each tool must integrate with the security framework and follow the established patterns for error handling, validation, and audit logging. Success here enables practical AI-filesystem collaboration.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement read_file tool with encoding detection and security validation
2. Implement write_file tool with human approval workflow integration
3. Implement list_directory tool with metadata extraction and filtering
4. Add comprehensive error handling for all file operation scenarios
5. Create integration tests for each tool with Claude Desktop
6. Validate performance meets <100ms response time requirements

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-25
- **TASK COMPLETED**: All three core file operations implemented and tested
- **read_file**: Complete with encoding detection (UTF-8, base64, auto), security validation, size limits
- **write_file**: Human approval workflow, file creation, directory creation, backup support
- **list_directory**: Metadata extraction, recursive traversal, filtering, security validation
- **Security Integration**: All operations integrate with SecurityManager for validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios covered with proper user feedback
- **Testing**: Extensive test suite covering all functionality and edge cases
- **Performance**: Operations optimized for <100ms response time requirement

### 2025-08-16
- Task created as core Phase 1 implementation priority
- Depends on completion of task_002 (MCP server foundation)
- Human approval workflow integration is critical for user trust
- Performance targets (<100ms) established for validation
