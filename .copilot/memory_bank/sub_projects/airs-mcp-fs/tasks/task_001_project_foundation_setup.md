# task_001 - Project Foundation Setup

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-22

## Original Request
Set up the foundational project structure for airs-mcp-fs, including Cargo.toml configuration, dependency management, basic modular architecture, and integration with the AIRS workspace ecosystem.

## Thought Process
This task establishes the critical foundation that all subsequent development depends on. Based on the comprehensive technical documentation, we need to:

1. **Cargo.toml Configuration**: Set up dependencies for MCP integration (airs-mcp), async runtime (tokio), binary processing (image, pdf), security (regex, path utilities), and development tools (testing, benchmarking).

2. **Modular Architecture**: Create the planned directory structure (mcp/, security/, binary/, filesystem/, config/) that aligns with the documented multi-layer architecture pattern.

3. **AIRS Integration**: Ensure proper workspace integration and shared pattern adoption from the existing AIRS ecosystem.

4. **Development Environment**: Configure build system, testing framework, and development tooling for productive development workflow.

The success of this task determines implementation velocity for all subsequent phases, making careful execution critical.

## Implementation Plan (FINALIZED - 2025-08-22)

### TECHNICAL DECISIONS APPROVED

**1. Root Workspace Dependency Management**
- ALL dependencies MUST be defined in root `/Cargo.toml` with latest stable versions
- airs-mcp path dependency: `airs-mcp = { path = "crates/airs-mcp" }`
- airs-mcp-fs inherits ALL dependencies from workspace using `.workspace = true`

**2. lib.rs Architecture Pattern**
- lib.rs functions as pure module coordinator (like mod.rs)
- ONLY module declarations (`pub mod`) and re-exports (`pub use`)
- NO type definitions, implementations, or business logic
- All types defined in appropriate module files

**3. Testing Strategy (Standard Rust Conventions)**
- Unit tests: Inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules within each source file
- Integration tests: Separate files in `tests/` directory only
- NO benchmark suites initially (focus on unit tests priority)

**4. Directory Structure**
```
src/
├── lib.rs              # Pure import/re-export coordinator
├── main.rs             # Binary entry point
├── mcp/                # MCP integration layer
├── security/           # Security and approval framework  
├── filesystem/         # Core filesystem operations
├── binary/             # Binary processing engine
└── config/             # Configuration management
```

**5. Workspace Standards Compliance (Mandatory)**
- §2.1: 3-Layer Import Organization in ALL files
- §3.2: chrono DateTime<Utc> for ALL time operations
- §4.3: Clean mod.rs organization (declarations + re-exports only)
- §5.1: Centralized dependency management at workspace level

### IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE
1. Update root Cargo.toml with latest stable versions
2. Configure airs-mcp-fs Cargo.toml with workspace inheritance
3. Create modular directory structure
4. Implement lib.rs as pure coordinator
5. Create main.rs binary entry point
6. Implement module foundations with inline unit tests
7. Validate workspace standards compliance

**Estimated Time**: ~3 hours total
**Next Action**: Begin with root Cargo.toml dependency additions

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%
