# task_001 - Project Foundation Setup

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request
Set up the foundational project structure for airs-mcp-fs, including Cargo.toml configuration, dependency management, basic modular architecture, and integration with the AIRS workspace ecosystem.

## Thought Process
This task establishes the critical foundation that all subsequent development depends on. Based on the comprehensive technical documentation, we need to:

1. **Cargo.toml Configuration**: Set up dependencies for MCP integration (airs-mcp), async runtime (tokio), binary processing (image, pdf), security (regex, path utilities), and development tools (testing, benchmarking).

2. **Modular Architecture**: Create the planned directory structure (mcp/, security/, binary/, filesystem/, config/) that aligns with the documented multi-layer architecture pattern.

3. **AIRS Integration**: Ensure proper workspace integration and shared pattern adoption from the existing AIRS ecosystem.

4. **Development Environment**: Configure build system, testing framework, and development tooling for productive development workflow.

The success of this task determines implementation velocity for all subsequent phases, making careful execution critical.

## Implementation Plan
1. Configure Cargo.toml with all required dependencies and workspace integration
2. Create modular project structure aligned with architectural design  
3. Set up basic lib.rs and main.rs with foundation types
4. Configure development tools (testing, benchmarking, documentation)
5. Validate build system and integration with AIRS workspace
6. Create basic CI/CD foundation for automated testing

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-16
- Task created during memory bank setup
- All architectural documentation and dependencies clearly defined
- Ready to begin implementation with comprehensive planning foundation
- Next session should start with Cargo.toml configuration
