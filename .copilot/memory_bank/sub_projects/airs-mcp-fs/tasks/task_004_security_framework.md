# task_004 - Security Framework Implementation

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request
Implement the comprehensive security framework including human-in-the-loop approval workflows, access control system with path allowlists/denylists, audit logging, and path validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Thought Process
Security is the cornerstone of airs-mcp-fs and what differentiates it from simple filesystem access tools. This task implements the security-first design that enables safe AI-filesystem interactions in enterprise environments:

1. **Human Approval Workflow**: Interactive terminal-based approval system that presents clear operation details and allows users to approve/deny filesystem changes. This builds trust and ensures human oversight.

2. **Access Control System**: Configuration-driven allowlists and denylists with pattern matching to restrict filesystem access to approved directories and prevent access to sensitive files.

3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations for compliance, security monitoring, and forensic analysis. Essential for enterprise adoption.

4. **Path Validation**: Robust path canonicalization and traversal attack prevention to ensure AI cannot access unauthorized locations.

This security framework must be transparent to users while providing enterprise-grade protection. The human approval workflow is particularly critical for user adoption and trust.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement human approval workflow with terminal interface
2. Create access control system with allowlist/denylist pattern matching
3. Add comprehensive audit logging for all operations
4. Implement path validation and canonicalization security
5. Create configuration system for security policies
6. Add security testing and validation suite
