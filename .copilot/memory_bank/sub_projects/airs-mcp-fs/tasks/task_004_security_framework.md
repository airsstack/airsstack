# task_004 - Security Framework Implementation

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request
Implement the comprehensive security framework including human-in-the-loop approval workflows, access control system with path allowlists/denylists, audit logging, and path validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Thought Process
Security is the cornerstone of airs-mcp-fs and what differentiates it from simple filesystem access tools. This task implements a **data-driven security framework** that uses behavioral logging to inform human-in-the-loop design rather than relying on assumptions:

1. **Behavioral Logging Foundation**: Comprehensive user behavior analytics to understand actual Claude Desktop usage patterns, tool interaction frequencies, and risk scenarios. This evidence-based approach replaces security design assumptions with real data.

2. **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Advanced logging infrastructure that captures user interaction patterns while protecting privacy through anonymization, path generalization, and PII filtering.

3. **Adaptive Approval Workflow**: Human approval system that evolves based on observed user behavior rather than static rules. Approval thresholds and workflows informed by actual usage patterns from Claude Desktop integration.

4. **Evidence-Based Access Control**: Configuration-driven security policies derived from behavioral analysis rather than theoretical threat models. Allowlists and denylists informed by actual user access patterns.

5. **Behavioral Audit Logging**: Enhanced audit system that captures not just operations but behavioral context, enabling security pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

This approach recognizes that effective security design for AI-human collaboration requires understanding actual user behavior patterns rather than making assumptions about how users will interact with Claude Desktop and MCP tools.

## Implementation Plan
**Phase 1: Behavioral Logging Infrastructure (Priority)**
1. Implement user behavior logging framework with privacy protection
2. Create pattern detection and analytics engine
3. Add Claude Desktop integration behavior tracking
4. Establish data collection and storage systems

**Phase 2: Data Collection Period (Weeks 1-4)**
5. Deploy behavioral logging with Claude Desktop integration
6. Collect real user interaction data across diverse usage scenarios
7. Perform statistical analysis of behavioral patterns
8. Identify security-relevant behavioral insights

**Phase 3: Evidence-Based Security Implementation (Week 5+)**
9. Design human approval workflows based on actual user behavior data
10. Implement adaptive access control informed by usage patterns
11. Create behavioral audit logging with pattern recognition
12. Add path validation and security testing framework

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-25
- **STRATEGIC SHIFT**: Updated task to implement **data-driven security framework** instead of assumption-based security design
- **Behavioral Logging Priority**: Focus on comprehensive user behavior analytics to inform security design decisions
- **Evidence-Based Approach**: Replace theoretical risk models with actual Claude Desktop usage patterns and user interaction data
- **Privacy-First Analytics**: Implement behavioral logging with strong privacy protection and anonymization
- **Security Design Evolution**: Security policies and approval workflows will be designed based on real user behavior evidence rather than assumptions

### 2025-08-16
- Task created as critical Phase 1 security implementation
- Depends on core file operations for integration testing
- Human approval workflow design is key to user experience
- Configuration system must support hierarchical policies
