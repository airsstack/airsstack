# [task_010] - Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-25  
**Updated:** 2025-08-28

## Original Request
Conduct comprehensive security audit and vulnerability assessment to validate security claims and identify potential security issues before production release.

## Thought Process
The project has a solid security foundation (Tasks 005, 006, 007 complete) but needs focused security validation before production release. Rather than comprehensive security assessment, focus on the most critical security validation areas:

1. **Manual Security Code Review**: Review production code paths for security vulnerabilities
2. **Path Traversal Testing**: Validate that path validation prevents directory traversal attacks  
3. **Input Validation Testing**: Test malformed input handling and edge cases
4. **Dependency Security Audit**: Ensure third-party dependencies have no known vulnerabilities

This focused approach provides essential security validation without over-engineering for a stdio-based MCP tool.

## Implementation Plan
- Conduct manual security code review for production code paths
- Implement comprehensive path traversal vulnerability testing
- Perform input validation security testing with malformed inputs
- Audit all dependencies for known security vulnerabilities

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** not_started - 0%

## Standards Compliance Checklist
**Workspace Standards Applied** (Reference: `workspace/shared_patterns.md`):
- [ ] **3-Layer Import Organization** (ยง2.1) - TBD for security tooling
- [ ] **chrono DateTime<Utc> Standard** (ยง3.2) - TBD for audit timestamps
- [ ] **Module Architecture Patterns** (ยง4.3) - TBD for security test organization
- [ ] **Dependency Management** (ยง5.1) - TBD for security tool dependencies
- [ ] **Zero Warning Policy** (workspace/zero_warning_policy.md) - TBD

## Compliance Evidence
[Evidence will be documented as security audit progresses]

## Security Issues Identified
**Critical Security Flaws:**
1. **Auto-Approval Security Bypass**: All operations auto-approved regardless of risk
2. **Panic-Based DoS**: Unwrap calls create denial-of-service attack vectors
3. **Missing Input Validation**: Potential for malformed input exploitation
4. **Configuration Security**: No secure configuration validation
5. **Error Information Leakage**: Error messages may leak sensitive information

**Security Claims vs. Reality:**
- **Claim**: "Enterprise-Grade Security" - **Reality**: Auto-approves everything
- **Claim**: "Human-in-the-Loop Approval" - **Reality**: TODO comment
- **Claim**: "Threat Detection" - **Reality**: No threat detection implemented
- **Claim**: "Audit Logging" - **Reality**: Basic logging only

## Technical Debt Documentation
**Created Debt (Reference: `workspace/technical_debt_management.md`):**
- **DEBT-SECURITY-016**: Critical security implementation gaps create vulnerabilities
- **DEBT-AUDIT-017**: Missing security audit creates compliance risks
- **DEBT-VALIDATION-018**: No security validation framework enables exploitation

## Security Standards Framework
**Required Security Standards:**
- OWASP Top 10 compliance validation
- Input validation and sanitization standards
- Authentication and authorization best practices
- Secure configuration management standards
- Vulnerability disclosure and response procedures

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-28
- **SCOPE FOCUSED**: Narrowed scope to 4 essential security validation objectives
- **Task Streamlined**: Removed comprehensive audit in favor of focused validation
- **Production Focus**: Target security areas most relevant for stdio-based MCP tool
- **Dependency Priority**: cargo audit for known vulnerabilities in third-party crates
- **Path Security**: Validate traversal protection in filesystem operations
- **Input Robustness**: Test malformed input handling across all entry points

### 2025-08-25
- Task created to address critical security validation gap
- Identified fundamental security flaws in current implementation  
- Planned comprehensive security audit with penetration testing
- Designed security validation framework for ongoing security assurance
