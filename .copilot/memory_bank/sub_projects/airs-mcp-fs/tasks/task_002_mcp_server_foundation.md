# task_002 - MCP Server Foundation

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-16  
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request
Implement the basic MCP server infrastructure with STDIO transport, JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling, tool registration framework, and Claude Desktop integration validation.

## Thought Process
This task builds on the project foundation to create the core MCP server that enables Claude Desktop integration. The implementation follows the documented multi-layer architecture:

1. **STDIO Transport**: Claude Desktop communicates via STDIO, requiring proper message framing and async handling without blocking operations.

2. **Tool Registration Framework**: Need a flexible system for registering filesystem operation tools that can be discovered by MCP clients.

3. **Message Routing**: JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling with proper error responses and async operation support.

4. **Integration Validation**: Must verify successful connection and tool discovery with Claude Desktop to ensure the foundation works correctly.

This task establishes the communication layer that all filesystem operations will depend on. Success here enables Phase 1 file operation development.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create basic MCP server struct using airs-mcp foundation
2. Implement STDIO transport with proper async message handling
3. Set up tool registration system for filesystem operations
4. Add JSON-RPC 2.0 message routing and response handling
5. Create integration test that connects to Claude Desktop
6. Validate tool discovery and basic communication
