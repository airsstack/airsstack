# [task_005] - Implement Actual Security Framework

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-25  
**Updated:** 2025-08-25

## Original Request
Implement actual security framework to replace placeholder approval workflows and establish enterprise-grade security controls for filesystem operations.

## Thought Process
The current security implementation is fundamentally broken with auto-approval workflows that create a massive security vulnerability. However, the STDIO transport constraint makes real-time human approval **architecturally impossible** since Claude Desktop owns stdin/stdout exclusively.

**Solution: Configuration-Based Security Policy System**
1. **Pre-Configured Security Policies**: User defines security rules before starting Claude Desktop
2. **Policy Engine**: Real-time policy evaluation without human interaction
3. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all filesystem operations
4. **Path-Based Permissions**: Granular control over filesystem access patterns
5. **Risk Assessment**: Automatic flagging of high-risk operations for post-session review

**Key Insight**: Instead of impossible real-time approval, implement **declarative security policies** that users configure once and enforce automatically.

## Implementation Plan
- Design configuration-based security policy system
- Implement policy engine for real-time evaluation
- Build comprehensive audit logging framework
- Create path-based permission validation
- Add risk assessment and flagging system
- Design security configuration management and validation

## Technical Debt Documentation
**Created Debt (Reference: `workspace/technical_debt_management.md`):**
- **DEBT-SECURITY-001**: Current auto-approval security bypass needs immediate replacement
- **DEBT-ARCH-002**: Security module architecture needs comprehensive redesign
- **DEBT-AUDIT-003**: Missing audit logging creates compliance gaps
