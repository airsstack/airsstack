# [task_005] - Implement Actual Security Framework

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-25  
**Updated:** 2025-08-25

## Original Request
Implement actual security framework to replace placeholder approval workflows and establish enterprise-grade security controls for filesystem operations.

## Thought Process
The current security implementation is fundamentally broken with auto-approval workflows that create a massive security vulnerability. However, the STDIO transport constraint makes real-time human approval **architecturally impossible** since Claude Desktop owns stdin/stdout exclusively.

**Solution: Configuration-Based Security Policy System**
1. **Pre-Configured Security Policies**: User defines security rules before starting Claude Desktop
2. **Policy Engine**: Real-time policy evaluation without human interaction
3. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all filesystem operations
4. **Path-Based Permissions**: Granular control over filesystem access patterns
5. **Risk Assessment**: Automatic flagging of high-risk operations for post-session review

**Key Insight**: Instead of impossible real-time approval, implement **declarative security policies** that users configure once and enforce automatically.

## Implementation Plan

**FOCUSED APPROACH: Critical & High Priority Only**

### **CRITICAL PATH (Production Blockers) - MUST COMPLETE**
1. **Subtask 5.1** - Security Policy Configuration Schema (Foundation for all security)
2. **Subtask 5.2** - Policy Engine Implementation (Core security evaluation - replaces auto-approval)
3. **Subtask 5.3** - Audit Logging System (Compliance requirement)

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Security Enhancement) - SHOULD COMPLETE** 
4. **Subtask 5.4** - Path-Based Permission System (Access control foundation)
5. **Subtask 5.5** - Operation-Type Restrictions (Operation-level security)
6. **Subtask 5.7** - Configuration Validation (Deployment safety)

### **EXCLUDED FROM SCOPE** (Medium/Nice-to-Have deferred)
- Subtask 5.6 (Risk Assessment) - Advanced analysis
- Subtask 5.8 (Configuration Hot-Reload) - Convenience feature  
- Subtask 5.9 (Security Metrics) - Monitoring enhancement
- Subtask 5.10 (Post-Session Review Tools) - Analysis tools

### **Essential Security Configuration Schema**
```toml
# Core security policy configuration
[security.filesystem]
allowed_paths = ["~/projects/**/*.{rs,md,toml,json}"]
denied_paths = ["**/.git/**", "**/.env*", "~/.*/**"]

[security.operations]
read_allowed = true
write_requires_policy = true     # Write ops need explicit policy match
delete_requires_explicit_allow = true  # Delete needs explicit "delete" permission

[security.policies.source_code]
patterns = ["**/*.{rs,py,js,ts}"]
operations = ["read", "write"]
risk_level = "low"
```

### **Security Operations Configuration Details**

**`write_requires_policy = true`**: Write operations must match a defined security policy to be allowed - cannot rely on just general `allowed_paths`. Files need explicit policy with "write" in operations array.

**`delete_requires_explicit_allow = true`**: Delete operations require explicit "delete" permission in policy operations array - never allowed by default, even if policy allows other operations.

### **Policy Engine Architecture**
```rust
pub struct PolicyEngine {
    policies: Vec<SecurityPolicy>,
    path_matcher: GlobMatcher,
    operation_rules: OperationRules,
}

// Replace auto-approval with real policy evaluation
impl PolicyEngine {
    pub fn evaluate_operation(&self, operation: &FileOperation) -> PolicyDecision {
        // Security-first evaluation logic
    }
}
```

## Standards Compliance Checklist
**Workspace Standards Applied** (Reference: `workspace/shared_patterns.md`):
- [ ] **3-Layer Import Organization** (ยง2.1) - TBD
- [ ] **chrono DateTime<Utc> Standard** (ยง3.2) - TBD for audit timestamps
- [ ] **Module Architecture Patterns** (ยง4.3) - TBD for security module organization
- [ ] **Dependency Management** (ยง5.1) - TBD for security dependencies
- [ ] **Zero Warning Policy** (workspace/zero_warning_policy.md) - TBD

## Compliance Evidence
[Evidence will be documented as implementation progresses]

## Technical Debt Documentation
**Created Debt (Reference: `workspace/technical_debt_management.md`):**
- **DEBT-SECURITY-001**: Current auto-approval security bypass needs immediate replacement
- **DEBT-ARCH-002**: Security module architecture needs comprehensive redesign
- **DEBT-AUDIT-003**: Missing audit logging creates compliance gaps

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-26
- **CRITICAL FOCUS REFINEMENT**: Streamlined implementation plan to focus on critical and high priority tasks only
- **Security Operations Design**: Detailed configuration schema for `write_requires_policy` and `delete_requires_explicit_allow`
- **Implementation Architecture**: Defined policy engine architecture to replace auto-approval security bypass
- **Scope Reduction**: Excluded medium/nice-to-have features (risk assessment, hot-reload, metrics, review tools) to focus on production blockers
- **Configuration Schema**: Finalized essential security configuration structure with TOML-based policies
- **Expected Outcome**: Transform from "2/10 demo-ware" to "7-8/10 production-ready" with focused approach
- Updated subtask priorities and removed deferred tasks for clarity

### 2025-08-25
