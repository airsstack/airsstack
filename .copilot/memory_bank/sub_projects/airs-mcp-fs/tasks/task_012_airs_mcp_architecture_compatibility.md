# [task_012] - airs_mcp_architecture_compatibility

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-09-22  
**Updated:** 2025-09-22

## Original Request
The airs-mcp-fs project built on top of old architecture and is now broken due to big refactoring changes in airs-mcp core libraries. Make it compatible with the latest architecture from airs-mcp. Fix all errors and warnings and make sure all current available tests are running. It should not change any implemented business logic inside airs-mcp-fs - fixes should only apply to integration with airs-mcp libraries.

## Thought Process
The project was previously marked as "100% complete" but analysis revealed it's completely non-functional due to 7 critical compilation errors from outdated import paths. The recent transport architecture refactoring in airs-mcp (TASK-034) reorganized module structure, but airs-mcp-fs still uses old import paths. 

Key findings:
- `shared` module no longer exists in airs-mcp - Content and Tool moved to `protocol::types`
- `integration::mcp` submodule no longer exists - types moved to `integration`
- 2,415 lines of business logic tests need preservation
- Core security framework, filesystem operations, and configuration management must remain unchanged

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation - Import Path Migration (CRITICAL PATH)
- Fix Content type imports: `airs_mcp::shared::protocol::Content` → `airs_mcp::protocol::types::Content`
- Fix Tool type imports: `airs_mcp::shared::protocol::Tool` → `airs_mcp::protocol::types::Tool`
- Fix integration imports: `airs_mcp::integration::mcp::{McpError, McpResult}` → `airs_mcp::integration::{McpError, McpResult}`
- Fix ToolProvider imports: `airs_mcp::shared::provider::ToolProvider` → `airs_mcp::providers::ToolProvider`
- Update main.rs server initialization imports

### Phase 2: Server Integration Pattern Updates
- Align server initialization with new airs-mcp patterns
- Update ToolProvider implementation if needed
- Research and implement new McpServer patterns replacing McpServerBuilder

### Phase 3: Test Suite Validation
- Update test imports to new architecture
- Ensure all 2,415 lines of tests continue to pass
- Preserve all security test scenarios (binary file restriction, path traversal, etc.)
- Validate integration tests work with new architecture

### Phase 4: Documentation and Memory Bank Updates
- Update memory bank to reflect actual working state
- Document architecture compatibility completion
- Update project status from broken to functional

**Overall Status:** in_progress - 90%
