# Project Brief: AIRS MCP-FS

**Sub-Project:** airs-mcp-fs  
**Created:** 2025-08-16  
**Status:** Foundation Phase - Documentation Complete, Implementation Pending  
**Dependencies:** airs-mcp (MCP foundation)

## Vision Statement

**AIRS MCP-FS** is a security-first filesystem bridge that enables Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible AI tools to intelligently read, write, and manage files in local development environments. This tool transforms AI assistance from passive consultation to active collaboration by allowing AI agents to both understand project context and create tangible artifacts directly in local environments.

## Strategic Positioning

### Market Opportunity
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Early entry into the MCP filesystem tool market
- **Technical Moat**: Advanced binary processing capabilities with Rust performance
- **Security Leadership**: Enterprise-grade security with human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Natural fit within the growing AIRS platform

### Core Value Propositions
- **Universal Filesystem Access**: Standardized MCP interface for all filesystem operations
- **Security-First Design**: Human-in-the-loop approval workflows with configurable policies
- **Advanced Binary Support**: Industry-leading binary file handling (images, PDFs, archives)
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-100ms response times with efficient memory management
- **Enterprise Ready**: Audit logging, compliance tracking, and threat detection

## Project Scope & Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **Fundamental Filesystem Operations**
   - Read/write files with automatic encoding detection
   - Directory management (create, list, delete, move, copy)
   - Cross-platform path handling with security validation

2. **Advanced Binary Processing**
   - **Image Support**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP with resizing/thumbnails
   - **PDF Processing**: Text extraction, image extraction, metadata analysis
   - **Format Detection**: Magic number-based file type identification
   - **Compression**: Automatic optimization for large file transfers

3. **Security Framework**
   - Human approval workflows for write/delete operations
   - Configurable allowlists/denylists for file paths
   - Threat detection and basic malware scanning
   - Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

4. **MCP Integration**
   - STDIO transport for Claude Desktop compatibility
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling for filesystem operations
   - Tool registration framework aligned with AIRS MCP patterns

### Technical Constraints
- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition for safety and performance
- **Dependencies**: Tokio async runtime, image processing crates, PDF handling
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times, streaming for files up to 1GB
- **Security**: Path validation, human approval, audit logging
- **Compatibility**: Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Foundation - Weeks 1-3)
- ✅ Core filesystem operations working through Claude Desktop
- ✅ Security framework preventing unauthorized access
- ✅ Human approval workflow functioning correctly
- ✅ Error handling providing helpful feedback
- ✅ Performance targets met (<100ms for basic operations)

### Phase 2 (Binary Processing - Weeks 4-6)
- Advanced image processing with format conversion
- PDF text and image extraction capabilities
- Magic number file type detection
- Streaming architecture for large files

### Phase 3 (Performance & Features - Weeks 7-9)
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Advanced security features and threat detection
- Caching and optimization for frequently accessed files
- Integration testing with multiple MCP clients

### Phase 4 (Enterprise & Ecosystem - Weeks 10-12)
- Enterprise features (SSO, compliance, audit)
- AIRS ecosystem integration and shared patterns
- Documentation and community features
- Production deployment and monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigation through comprehensive testing and audits
- **Performance Issues**: Streaming architecture and resource limits
- **MCP Protocol Evolution**: Modular architecture for easy updates

### Strategic Risks
- **Market Competition**: First-mover advantage and technical differentiation
- **Scope Creep**: Phased development with clear validation criteria
- **Resource Allocation**: Clear task breakdown and milestone tracking

## Integration with AIRS Ecosystem

### Shared Components
- **AIRS MCP Foundation**: JSON-RPC client, transport, and tool registration
- **Workspace Patterns**: Configuration management, error handling, logging
- **Security Standards**: Consistent approval workflows and audit patterns

### Cross-Project Benefits
- Filesystem access for other AIRS tools (memspec, knowledge bases)
- Shared security and configuration patterns
- Common performance and reliability standards
- Unified documentation and testing approaches

## Implementation Philosophy

### Security-First Design
Every filesystem operation requires explicit validation and, where appropriate, human approval. Security is not an afterthought but a core architectural principle.

### Performance Excellence
Rust's performance characteristics enable sub-100ms response times while maintaining memory safety. Streaming architecture ensures scalability for large files.

### User Experience Focus
The tool bridges AI intelligence with local development environments, requiring seamless integration with existing workflows and intuitive approval processes.

### Enterprise Readiness
From day one, the tool includes audit logging, compliance tracking, and configurable security policies suitable for enterprise environments.
