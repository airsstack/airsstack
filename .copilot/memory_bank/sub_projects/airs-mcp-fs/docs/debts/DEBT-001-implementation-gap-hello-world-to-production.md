# DEBT-001: Implementation Gap - Hello World to Production

**ID**: DEBT-001  
**Title**: Implementation Gap - Hello World to Production  
**Status**: Active  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Implementation Gap  
**Added**: 2025-08-22  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22  

## Location
**File**: `src/main.rs`  
**Lines**: 1-5 (entire file)  
**Code Context**:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Description
Complete implementation gap between comprehensive architectural planning and minimal "Hello, world!" implementation. The project has extensive documentation, clear architecture, and detailed requirements but lacks any functional code.

## Technical Details
**Current State**: 
- ✅ **Comprehensive Planning**: Complete project brief, requirements, architecture
- ✅ **Memory Bank Setup**: Full documentation structure and context
- ✅ **Development Roadmap**: Detailed task breakdown and implementation phases
- ❌ **Implementation**: Only basic Rust project skeleton with hello world

**Expected Implementation Scope**:
1. **MCP Server Foundation** (Week 1-2)
   - STDIO transport integration with airs-mcp
   - Tool registration framework
   - JSON-RPC message handling
   - Basic security framework

2. **Core Filesystem Operations** (Week 3-4)
   - read_file tool with encoding detection
   - write_file tool with human approval workflow
   - list_directory tool with metadata
   - Error handling and validation

3. **Security Framework** (Week 5-6)
   - Human-in-the-loop approval system
   - Configurable security policies
   - Threat detection and assessment
   - Comprehensive audit logging

4. **Advanced Features** (Week 7-8)
   - Binary file processing (images, PDFs)
   - Performance optimization
   - Integration testing with Claude Desktop
   - Documentation and deployment preparation

## Impact Assessment
- **Business Impact**: HIGH - No functional value until implementation begins
- **Technical Impact**: HIGH - Foundation phase blocking all subsequent development
- **User Impact**: CRITICAL - Tool is unusable in current state
- **Timeline Impact**: IMMEDIATE - Implementation must begin to meet project goals

## Remediation Plan
**Approach**: Systematic implementation following documented architecture and roadmap

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks full-time development

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
```rust
// Target main.rs structure
use airs_mcp::transport::stdio::StdioTransport;
use airs_mcp_fs::server::FilesystemMcpServer;
use airs_mcp_fs::security::SecurityPolicy;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize logging
    tracing_subscriber::init();
    
    // Load configuration
    let config = load_configuration().await?;
    
    // Create security policy
    let security_policy = SecurityPolicy::from_config(&config);
    
    // Initialize filesystem MCP server
    let server = FilesystemMcpServer::new(security_policy).await?;
    
    // Start MCP server with STDIO transport
    let transport = StdioTransport::new();
    server.run(transport).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Phase 2: Core Module Structure

```

### Phase 3: Dependency Configuration
```toml
# Target Cargo.toml dependencies
[dependencies]
airs-mcp = { path = "../airs-mcp" }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
thiserror = "1.0"
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
config = "0.14"
walkdir = "2.0"
mime_guess = "2.0"
encoding_rs = "0.8"
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- MCP server successfully starts and responds to Claude Desktop
- Basic filesystem tools (read, write, list) functional
- Security validation integrated into all operations
- Human approval workflow operational for write operations
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Audit logging for all operations
- Integration tests passing with real Claude Desktop instance

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Implementation Risks**:
- **Complexity Underestimation**: 4-6 week estimate may be insufficient
- **Integration Challenges**: airs-mcp integration may require modifications
- **Security Implementation**: Human approval workflow complexity
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-100ms response times may be challenging

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Phased Implementation**: Deliver basic functionality first, enhance iteratively
- **Early Integration**: Test Claude Desktop compatibility early and often
- **Security-First**: Implement security framework before advanced features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking during development

## Dependencies
**Blocking Dependencies**:
- **airs-mcp stability**: Foundation must be stable for integration
- **Development environment**: Rust toolchain and development setup
- **Claude Desktop access**: Testing environment for MCP integration

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Security policy design decisions (to be documented in ADRs)
- Human approval workflow user interface design
- Configuration file format and management approach
- Audit logging format and storage strategy

## Best Practices
**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Follow workspace standards (§2.1, §3.2, §4.3, §5.1) from inception
- Implement comprehensive tests alongside features
- Document architectural decisions as ADRs during implementation
- Create knowledge documentation for complex algorithms and patterns
- Track implementation progress in task management system

**Quality Gates**:
- Zero clippy warnings maintained throughout development
- All new code covered by unit and integration tests
- Security validations required for all filesystem operations
- Performance benchmarks meet sub-100ms targets for read operations

## Notes
This debt represents the natural gap between planning completion and implementation begin rather than traditional technical debt. The comprehensive planning phase provides a strong foundation that should accelerate implementation and reduce typical development risks.

The implementation approach should leverage the extensive documentation and architecture already established, treating the memory bank content as the authoritative specification for development.

## Related Issues
- **Future GitHub Issues**: Create implementation milestone tracking issues
- **ADR Dependencies**: Implementation decisions will generate multiple ADRs
- **Knowledge Documentation**: Complex implementations will require knowledge docs

## Maintenance
**Review Date**: Weekly during active implementation  
**Review Criteria**: Implementation progress against documented roadmap and architecture  
**Completion Criteria**: Full production-ready MCP server with comprehensive filesystem capabilities

**Success Metrics**:
- Claude Desktop successfully connects and discovers all tools
- All core filesystem operations functional with security validation
- Human approval workflow operational and user-friendly
- Performance targets met (sub-100ms for read operations)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in initial security assessment
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) with passing integration tests
