# Active Context: AIRS MCP-FS

**Updated:** 2025-08-16  
**Phase:** Foundation Setup Complete  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation Phase 1  
**Next Milestone:** Core Filesystem Operations

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority: task_001 Implementation Ready
We have completed comprehensive planning and technical decision-making for task_001 (Project Foundation Setup). All architectural decisions are finalized and documented, providing a clear implementation roadmap.

**Current State**: 
- âœ… Complete project documentation and specifications
- âœ… Comprehensive technical architecture defined
- âœ… Memory bank setup complete with full context preservation
- âœ… **NEW**: Technical decisions finalized for task_001 implementation
- âœ… **NEW**: Implementation plan approved with user feedback integration
- ðŸ”„ **NEXT**: Execute task_001 foundation setup implementation

### Key Technical Decisions (2025-08-22)

#### **Root Workspace Dependency Management**
- **Decision**: ALL dependencies MUST be centralized in root Cargo.toml with latest stable versions
- **Impact**: Ensures consistency across workspace, simplified version management
- **Implementation**: Add airs-mcp path dependency + binary processing dependencies to workspace

#### **lib.rs Pure Coordinator Pattern**
- **Decision**: lib.rs functions as pure module coordinator (like mod.rs pattern)
- **Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns, no business logic in entry points
- **Implementation**: Only module declarations and re-exports, types defined in appropriate modules

#### **Standard Rust Testing Conventions**
- **Decision**: Inline unit tests with `#[cfg(test)]` modules, no separate test files
- **Rationale**: Follows standard Rust conventions, keeps tests close to implementation
- **Priority**: Unit tests first, integration tests second, no benchmarking initially

### Key Implementation Priorities

#### 1. **Project Foundation Setup** (Week 1)
- **Cargo.toml Configuration**: Set up dependencies for MCP, async runtime, and core libraries
- **Basic Project Structure**: Create modular crate structure aligned with architectural design
- **AIRS MCP Integration**: Establish connection with existing airs-mcp foundation
- **Development Environment**: Configure build system, testing, and development tooling

#### 2. **MCP Server Foundation** (Week 1)
- **STDIO Transport**: Implement basic MCP server with STDIO transport for Claude Desktop
- **Tool Registration**: Set up framework for registering filesystem operation tools
- **Message Handling**: JSON-RPC 2.0 message routing and response handling
- **Integration Validation**: Verify Claude Desktop can connect and discover tools

#### 3. **Core File Operations** (Week 2)
- **read_file Tool**: File reading with encoding detection and security validation
- **write_file Tool**: File writing with human approval workflow integration
- **list_directory Tool**: Directory listing with metadata and filtering capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error framework with user-friendly messages

## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Major Decision: Memory Bank Architecture
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive multi-project memory bank for airs_mcp_fs  
**Context**: Need for persistent context management across development sessions  
**Impact**: Enables seamless continuation of work with full project context preservation

### Documentation Strategy Confirmation
**Comprehensive Documentation First**: The decision to complete all architectural documentation before implementation provides:
- Clear implementation roadmap with minimal ambiguity
- Reduced risk of scope creep and architectural drift
- Better stakeholder alignment and expectation management
- Foundation for automated testing and validation

### Technology Stack Finalization
**Core Dependencies Confirmed**:
- **airs-mcp**: Foundation for MCP client integration
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for high-performance I/O
- **Image/PDF Processing**: Specialized crates for binary content handling
- **Security Framework**: Custom implementation for approval workflows and audit logging

## Next Steps & Action Items

### Immediate Actions (Ready for Implementation)
1. **Update root Cargo.toml** with airs-mcp-fs dependencies (latest stable versions)
2. **Configure airs-mcp-fs Cargo.toml** with workspace inheritance pattern
3. **Create modular directory structure** following finalized architecture
4. **Implement lib.rs pure coordinator** with module declarations and re-exports only

### Implementation Readiness
- âœ… All technical decisions documented and approved
- âœ… Workspace standards compliance requirements defined
- âœ… Testing strategy aligned with standard Rust conventions
- âœ… Dependency management strategy finalized
- âœ… Architecture patterns established

### Execution Plan
**Estimated Time**: ~3 hours total
**Approach**: Sequential implementation of subtasks 1.1 through 1.6
**Validation**: Zero warnings policy + workspace standards enforcement

## Active Considerations & Open Questions

### Implementation Approach
**Question**: Should we start with a minimal viable product (MVP) approach or implement the full Phase 1 scope?
**Current Thinking**: Follow the documented Phase 1 plan completely, as the scope is well-defined and manageable
**Rationale**: Comprehensive planning reduces risk of technical debt and ensures security-first design from day one

### Security Implementation Priority
**Focus**: Human approval workflow is critical for user trust and adoption
**Approach**: Implement approval workflow early in development, even for basic operations
**Validation**: Test approval workflow with real Claude Desktop integration scenarios

### Performance Baseline
**Target**: Establish performance measurement from the beginning
**Metrics**: Response time, memory usage, file size handling capabilities
**Testing**: Implement benchmarking suite parallel to feature development

## Integration Context

### AIRS Ecosystem Alignment
- **Consistent Patterns**: Following established AIRS patterns for configuration, error handling, and async design
- **Shared Dependencies**: Leveraging airs-mcp foundation for MCP client infrastructure
- **Cross-Project Benefits**: Filesystem access will enhance other AIRS tools (memspec, knowledge bases)

### Claude Desktop Integration
- **Primary Target**: Claude Desktop is the primary MCP client for initial development and testing
- **Transport**: STDIO transport is the standard for Claude Desktop integration
- **User Experience**: Focus on seamless integration feeling like "Claude can actually do things"

## Risk Mitigation Status

### Technical Risks - Mitigation Active
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Human approval workflow and comprehensive validation in place
- **Performance Issues**: Streaming architecture planned for large files
- **MCP Protocol Changes**: Modular architecture enables easy protocol updates

### Strategic Risks - Monitoring
- **Scope Creep**: Well-defined phase boundaries with clear validation criteria
- **Resource Allocation**: Clear task breakdown with realistic timelines
- **Market Timing**: First-mover advantage with rapid but careful development

## Context for Future Sessions

### Memory Bank Integration
This sub-project now has complete memory bank setup with:
- Comprehensive project context and technical documentation
- Clear task management structure ready for implementation tracking
- Integration with workspace-level AIRS patterns and shared components
- Foundation for cross-session context preservation and team collaboration

### Development Continuity
Future development sessions can immediately resume with:
- Full understanding of project vision, architecture, and technical requirements
- Clear next steps and implementation priorities
- Established patterns for security, performance, and integration
- Ready-to-execute task breakdown aligned with documented roadmap

The foundation is complete. The next session should focus on **executing Phase 1, Week 1 implementation tasks** starting with Cargo.toml setup and basic project structure creation.
