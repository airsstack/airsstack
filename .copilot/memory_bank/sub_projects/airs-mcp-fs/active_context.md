# Active Context: AIRS MCP-FS

**Updated:** 2025-08-28  
**Phase:** Configuration Management System Implementation ‚ö°  
**Status:** **TRANSITIONING TO TASK 006 - CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT CRITICAL**  
**Major Milestone:** Task 005 Complete ‚Üí Task 006 Starting (Production Blocker)

## **‚ö° STARTING TASK 006 - REAL CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - 2025-08-28**

### **üîß CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKER - PLACEHOLDER CONFIGURATION SYSTEM**
**Current Issue:** The existing configuration system uses stub implementations that prevent actual deployment. Need enterprise-grade configuration management system.

### **Implementation Strategy: CRITICAL & HIGH PRIORITY ONLY**
Following user agreement, implementation plan refined to focus on production-blocking issues while deferring operational enhancements for future phases.

**Target Outcome**: Transform from **"2/10 demo-ware"** to **"8-9/10 production-ready"**

### **CRITICAL PATH TASKS (Production Blockers) - PROGRESS UPDATE**
- **[task_005.1]** Security Policy Configuration Schema ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** 
- **[task_005.2]** Policy Engine Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- **[task_005.3]** Audit Logging System ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- **[task_005.4]** Path-Based Permission System ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- **[task_005.5]** Operation-Type Restrictions Framework ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** **‚Üê JUST COMPLETED**
- **[task_005.7]** Configuration Validation **üéØ FINAL TARGET**

### **HIGH PRIORITY TASKS (Security Enhancement)**
- **[task_005.4]** Path-Based Permission System ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Advanced glob pattern validation operational
- **[task_005.5]** Operation-Type Restrictions üîÑ **NEXT TARGET** - Read/write/delete/create permission granularity
- **[task_005.7]** Configuration Validation - Startup config validation with clear errors

### **ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
**Permissions Module Refactoring** (security/permissions/ sub-module):
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE**: 541-line permissions.rs successfully refactored into 5 focused modules
- **Enhanced Structure**: 
  - `mod.rs` (93 lines) - Module coordinator with comprehensive architectural documentation
  - `level.rs` (212 lines) - PermissionLevel enum hierarchy with operation validation
  - `rule.rs` (537 lines) - PathPermissionRule with advanced glob pattern matching
  - `evaluation.rs` (342 lines) - PermissionEvaluation result framework with risk assessment
  - `validator.rs` (771 lines) - PathPermissionValidator main engine with policy integration
- **Documentation Excellence**: Module-level, type-level, and method-level docs with ASCII diagrams
- **Quality Assurance**: All 107 tests passing, zero compilation warnings, full API compatibility
- **Technical Debt Resolved**: DEBT-REFACTOR-001 completely eliminated
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced maintainability, improved onboarding, clearer API structure

### **SECURITY OPERATIONS CONFIGURATION**
```toml
[security.operations]
read_allowed = true
write_requires_policy = true     # Write ops need explicit policy match
delete_requires_explicit_allow = true  # Delete needs explicit "delete" permission
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **`write_requires_policy`**: Write operations must match defined security policy, cannot rely on general allowed_paths
- **`delete_requires_explicit_allow`**: Delete operations require explicit "delete" permission in policy - never allowed by default

### **DEFERRED SCOPE** (Medium/Nice-to-Have)
- Risk Assessment System (Advanced analysis)
- Configuration Hot-Reload (Convenience feature)
- Security Metrics & Monitoring (Operational enhancement)  
- Post-Session Review Tools (Analysis tools)

### **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS**
1. **Complete task_005.5** (Operation-Type Restrictions) - Granular read/write/delete/create permission controls
2. **Implement task_005.7** (Configuration Validation) - Startup config validation with clear error messaging
3. **Continue security framework enhancement** - Build on solid modular architecture foundation

**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive multi-project memory bank for airs_mcp_fs  
**Context**: Need for persistent context management across development sessions  
**Impact**: Enables seamless continuation of work with full project context preservation

### Documentation Strategy Confirmation
**Comprehensive Documentation First**: The decision to complete all architectural documentation before implementation provides:
- Clear implementation roadmap with minimal ambiguity
- Reduced risk of scope creep and architectural drift
- Better stakeholder alignment and expectation management
- Foundation for automated testing and validation

### Technology Stack Finalization
**Core Dependencies Confirmed**:
- **airs-mcp**: Foundation for MCP client integration
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for high-performance I/O
- **Image/PDF Processing**: Specialized crates for binary content handling
- **Security Framework**: Custom implementation for approval workflows and audit logging

## Next Steps & Action Items

### Immediate Actions (Ready for Implementation)
1. **Update root Cargo.toml** with airs-mcp-fs dependencies (latest stable versions)
2. **Configure airs-mcp-fs Cargo.toml** with workspace inheritance pattern
3. **Create modular directory structure** following finalized architecture
4. **Implement lib.rs pure coordinator** with module declarations and re-exports only

### Implementation Readiness
- ‚úÖ All technical decisions documented and approved
- ‚úÖ Workspace standards compliance requirements defined
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy aligned with standard Rust conventions
- ‚úÖ Dependency management strategy finalized
- ‚úÖ Architecture patterns established

### Execution Plan
**Estimated Time**: ~3 hours total
**Approach**: Sequential implementation of subtasks 1.1 through 1.6
**Validation**: Zero warnings policy + workspace standards enforcement

## Active Considerations & Open Questions

### Implementation Approach
**Question**: Should we start with a minimal viable product (MVP) approach or implement the full Phase 1 scope?
**Current Thinking**: Follow the documented Phase 1 plan completely, as the scope is well-defined and manageable
**Rationale**: Comprehensive planning reduces risk of technical debt and ensures security-first design from day one

### Security Implementation Priority
**Focus**: Human approval workflow is critical for user trust and adoption
**Approach**: Implement approval workflow early in development, even for basic operations
**Validation**: Test approval workflow with real Claude Desktop integration scenarios

### Performance Baseline
**Target**: Establish performance measurement from the beginning
**Metrics**: Response time, memory usage, file size handling capabilities
**Testing**: Implement benchmarking suite parallel to feature development

## Integration Context

### AIRS Ecosystem Alignment
- **Consistent Patterns**: Following established AIRS patterns for configuration, error handling, and async design
- **Shared Dependencies**: Leveraging airs-mcp foundation for MCP client infrastructure
- **Cross-Project Benefits**: Filesystem access will enhance other AIRS tools (memspec, knowledge bases)

### Claude Desktop Integration
- **Primary Target**: Claude Desktop is the primary MCP client for initial development and testing
- **Transport**: STDIO transport is the standard for Claude Desktop integration
- **User Experience**: Focus on seamless integration feeling like "Claude can actually do things"

## Risk Mitigation Status

### Technical Risks - Mitigation Active
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Human approval workflow and comprehensive validation in place
- **Performance Issues**: Streaming architecture planned for large files
- **MCP Protocol Changes**: Modular architecture enables easy protocol updates

### Strategic Risks - Monitoring
- **Scope Creep**: Well-defined phase boundaries with clear validation criteria
- **Resource Allocation**: Clear task breakdown with realistic timelines
- **Market Timing**: First-mover advantage with rapid but careful development

## Context for Future Sessions

### Memory Bank Integration
This sub-project now has complete memory bank setup with:
- Comprehensive project context and technical documentation
- Clear task management structure ready for implementation tracking
- Integration with workspace-level AIRS patterns and shared components
- Foundation for cross-session context preservation and team collaboration

### Development Continuity
Future development sessions can immediately resume with:
- Full understanding of project vision, architecture, and technical requirements
- Clear next steps and implementation priorities
- Established patterns for security, performance, and integration
- Ready-to-execute task breakdown aligned with documented roadmap

The foundation is complete. The next session should focus on **executing Phase 1, Week 1 implementation tasks** starting with Cargo.toml setup and basic project structure creation.
