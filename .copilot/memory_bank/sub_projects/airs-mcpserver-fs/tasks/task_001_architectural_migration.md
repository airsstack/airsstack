# [task_001] - Architectural Migration: airs-mcp-fs to airs-mcpserver-fs

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Added:** 2025-09-22  
**Updated:** 2025-09-23  
**Completed:** 2025-09-23

## Original Request
Migrate the existing `airs-mcp-fs` project from `crates/airs-mcp-fs` to `mcp-servers/airs-mcpserver-fs` to establish proper architectural separation between core AIRS libraries and MCP server implementations. This migration will create the foundation for a broader MCP server ecosystem while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining backward compatibility during transition.

## Thought Process
The architectural migration represents a strategic evolution of the AIRS ecosystem. The current placement of `airs-mcp-fs` within the `crates/` directory alongside core libraries like `airs-mcp` and `airs-memspec` creates architectural confusion. MCP servers should be clearly separated from foundation libraries.

Key considerations driving this migration:
1. **Architectural Clarity**: MCP servers have different lifecycle and deployment patterns than core libraries
2. **Ecosystem Scalability**: Future MCP servers (database, git, etc.) need consistent organizational structure
3. **Naming Consistency**: `airs-mcpserver-fs` clearly indicates server implementation role
4. **Zero Regression**: All existing functionality must be preserved during migration
5. **User Experience**: Minimal disruption to existing Claude Desktop integrations

The gradual migration approach balances architectural improvement with user stability.

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Project Structure Creation** (Days 1-2)
**Objective**: Create new directory structure and basic project setup

#### Subtasks:
1. **Directory Structure Creation**
