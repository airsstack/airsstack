- **DEBT-CRITICAL-001**: Production unwrap calls (Requires verification)

### High Priority  
- **DEBT-REFACTOR-001**: Permissions module refactoring (Architecture may be different)

### Medium Priority
- **DEBT-001**: Implementation gap (May be resolved)
- **DEBT-002**: MCP server scope (May be resolved)

## Migration Notes

**Source**: All debt records migrated from `airs-mcp-fs` sub-project  
**Status**: Requires assessment for applicability to new architecture  
**Action Plan**: Review each debt item to determine if it still applies to airs-mcpserver-fs

### Assessment Required
1. **Security vulnerabilities**: Do they exist in the new codebase?
2. **Unwrap calls**: Are there unwrap() calls in the migrated code?
3. **Implementation gaps**: Are they resolved in the new architecture?
4. **Architecture debt**: Is the permissions module architecture different?

### Next Steps
1. Review each migrated debt item
2. Mark as resolved if no longer applicable
3. Update with new specifics if still relevant
4. Create new debt items for any new issues found

**Debt Review Strategy:**
1. Audit legacy project for existing technical debt
2. Evaluate whether to migrate debt or resolve during transition
3. Document decisions with clear rationale
4. Track new debt introduced during migration

**Quality Gate**: Migration should not introduce new technical debt without explicit documentation and remediation plans.
