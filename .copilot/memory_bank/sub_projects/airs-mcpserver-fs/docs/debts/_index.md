# Technical Debt Index

**Sub-Project:** airs-mcpserver-fs  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-22  
**Status:** Migration Phase - No Technical Debt Yet

## Overview

This index tracks technical debt items for the AIRS MCP Server - Filesystem project. During the migration from `airs-mcp-fs` to `airs-mcpserver-fs`, this registry will track any shortcuts or compromises made during the transition.

## Active Debt Items

*None - Migration phase starting with clean slate*

## Resolved Debt Items

*None yet*

## Migration-Related Debt Tracking

During the architectural migration, any technical debt introduced will be documented here following the workspace template pattern:

- **DEBT-001**: [Placeholder for first debt item if needed]
- **Format**: DEBT-XXX-brief-description.md
- **Categories**: DEBT-ARCH, DEBT-QUALITY, DEBT-DOCS, DEBT-TEST, DEBT-PERF

## Legacy Debt Assessment

The migration provides an opportunity to address any technical debt from the legacy `airs-mcp-fs` project:

**Debt Review Strategy:**
1. Audit legacy project for existing technical debt
2. Evaluate whether to migrate debt or resolve during transition
3. Document decisions with clear rationale
4. Track new debt introduced during migration

**Quality Gate**: Migration should not introduce new technical debt without explicit documentation and remediation plans.
