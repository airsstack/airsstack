# DEBT-REFACTOR-001: Permissions Module Architectural Refactoring (MIGRATED - ASSESSMENT REQUIRED)

**ID**: DEBT-REFACTOR-001  
**Status**: Migrated - Assessment Required (Architecture May Have Changed)  
**Priority**: Medium (Original) / Assessment Required  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Migrated**: 2025-09-23  
**Assessment Required**: Check if permissions module architecture differs in airs-mcpserver-fs

## Migration Notice

**Source**: Migrated from `airs-mcp-fs` technical debt registry  
**Original Issue**: Permissions module needed architectural refactoring  
**Assessment Required**: Verify current permissions module architecture

## Original Issue (Legacy)

The legacy airs-mcp-fs permissions module required architectural refactoring for better organization and maintainability.

## Assessment for airs-mcpserver-fs

**Check Current Architecture**:
- [ ] **Module Organization**: Is permissions module well-organized?
- [ ] **Sub-module Structure**: Proper separation of concerns?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Comprehensive module documentation?
- [ ] **Testability**: Good test coverage and structure?

**Current Permissions Module Location**: `mcp-servers/airs-mcpserver-fs/src/security/permissions/`

## Expected Assessment Outcomes

### If Architecture is Improved
- **Status**: Mark as "Resolved - Architecture Migration Success"
- **Documentation**: Note architectural improvements in new codebase

### If Issues Still Exist
- **Status**: Keep as "Active" with updated specifics
- **Update**: Map to current module structure and specific issues

## Next Steps

1. Review current permissions module architecture
2. Compare with original refactoring requirements
3. Update debt status based on findings
4. Document architectural improvements if resolved
