# DEBT-002: MCP Server Implementation Scope Limitations (MIGRATED - ASSESSMENT REQUIRED)

**ID**: DEBT-002  
**Status**: Migrated - Assessment Required (Likely Resolved)  
**Priority**: Medium (Original) / Assessment Required  
**Category**: Implementation Gap  
**Migrated**: 2025-09-23  
**Assessment Required**: This debt may be resolved in airs-mcpserver-fs

## Migration Notice

**Source**: Migrated from `airs-mcp-fs` technical debt registry  
**Original Issue**: MCP server implementation scope limitations  
**Assessment Required**: Verify if limitations still exist in new architecture

## Original Issue (Legacy)

The legacy airs-mcp-fs had scope limitations in MCP server implementation.

## Assessment for airs-mcpserver-fs

**Check Current Implementation**:
- [ ] **Tool Coverage**: Are all planned tools implemented?
- [ ] **MCP Compliance**: Full MCP protocol compliance?
- [ ] **Feature Completeness**: All required features implemented?
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Performance targets met?

## Expected Resolution

**Most Likely Outcome**: RESOLVED through architectural migration to airs-mcpserver-fs

**Next Steps**: 
1. Review current implementation scope
2. Verify all limitations addressed
3. Mark as resolved if complete
4. Update with specific remaining limitations if any exist
