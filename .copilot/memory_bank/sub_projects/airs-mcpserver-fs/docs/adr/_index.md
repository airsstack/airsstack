# Architecture Decision Records Index

**Sub-Project:** airs-mcpserver-fs  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-22  
**Status:** Migration Phase - Initial ADR Planning

## Overview

This index tracks Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the AIRS MCP Server - Filesystem project. During migration from `airs-mcp-fs`, significant architectural decisions will be documented here.

## Migration ADRs

### Planned ADRs for Migration
- **ADR-001**: [Planned] Gradual Migration Strategy vs. Complete Rewrite
- **ADR-002**: [Planned] Project Structure and Naming Convention Decision
- **ADR-003**: [Planned] Backward Compatibility Implementation Approach
- **ADR-004**: [Planned] Memory Bank Sub-Project Organization

## Legacy Architecture Decisions

### Decisions to Review and Document
From the legacy `airs-mcp-fs` project, several architectural decisions should be formally documented:

1. **Security-First Architecture**: 5-layer security framework design
2. **Human Approval Workflows**: Interactive authorization for write operations
3. **Configuration Management**: Hierarchical configuration with environment overrides
4. **MCP Protocol Integration**: STDIO transport and tool registration patterns

### Decision Documentation Strategy
1. **Review**: Analyze legacy project for implicit architectural decisions
2. **Document**: Formalize important decisions as ADRs
3. **Validate**: Confirm decisions remain valid in new structure
4. **Update**: Modify decisions if new architecture requires changes

## ADR Workflow

### Decision Making Process
1. **Identify Decision Point**: Recognize when architectural decision is needed
2. **Gather Context**: Document problem, constraints, and stakeholders
3. **Evaluate Options**: Analysis of alternatives with pros/cons
4. **Make Decision**: Select approach with clear rationale
5. **Document ADR**: Create formal record using template
6. **Communicate**: Share decision with relevant stakeholders

### ADR Status Lifecycle
- **Proposed**: Decision under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and implementation planned
- **Implemented**: Decision deployed in codebase
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer applicable
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR

**Migration Focus**: Priority on documenting decisions that affect migration strategy and new project architecture while preserving successful patterns from legacy implementation.
