# Knowledge Documentation Index

**Sub-Project:** airs-mcpserver-fs  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-22  
**Status:** Migration Phase - Knowledge Transfer from Legacy Project

## Overview

This index tracks technical knowledge documentation for the AIRS MCP Server - Filesystem project. During migration from `airs-mcp-fs`, relevant architectural and implementation knowledge will be captured here.

## Architecture Knowledge

### Security Framework (Legacy Preserved)
*Placeholder for security architecture knowledge from airs-mcp-fs*
- 5-layer security framework design
- Human approval workflow patterns
- Path validation and traversal prevention
- Audit logging and compliance tracking

### MCP Integration Patterns (Updated for New Architecture)
*Knowledge about integration with latest airs-mcp architecture*
- MessageHandler implementation patterns
- STDIO transport configuration
- Tool registration and lifecycle management

### MCP Server Connection Troubleshooting (Production-Ready)
**File:** `mcp_server_connection_troubleshooting.md`  
**Status:** Complete - Critical debugging solutions  
**Knowledge Level:** Expert  

Core troubleshooting knowledge for MCP protocol integration:
- Server lifecycle management (transport.wait_for_completion)
- Capability schema validation (manual JSON construction)
- Protocol message handling (requests vs notifications)
- Client integration patterns (Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector)
- Best practices for capability advertising consistency

### Performance Optimization (Validated)
*Performance patterns proven in legacy implementation*
- Sub-100ms response time strategies
- Async operation management
- Resource usage optimization
- Memory management patterns

## Implementation Knowledge

### Configuration Management (Proven)
*Configuration patterns from successful legacy deployment*
- Hierarchical configuration structure
- Environment-specific overrides
- Security policy configuration
- Runtime configuration updates

### Error Handling Patterns (Tested)
*Error handling strategies validated in production*
- Structured error hierarchies
- Context preservation through operation chains
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery and retry strategies

## Migration Knowledge

### Architectural Migration Patterns
*Knowledge specific to the migration process*
- Gradual migration strategies
- Backward compatibility implementation
- Documentation synchronization approaches
- Validation and testing methodologies

## Planned Knowledge Documentation

### Post-Migration Knowledge Capture
1. **Migration Lessons Learned**: Document insights from the migration process
2. **Updated Architecture Patterns**: Patterns specific to new structure
3. **Integration Best Practices**: MCP server integration guidelines
4. **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and resolution strategies

**Knowledge Transfer Strategy**: Systematically migrate relevant knowledge from legacy project while updating for new architectural context.
