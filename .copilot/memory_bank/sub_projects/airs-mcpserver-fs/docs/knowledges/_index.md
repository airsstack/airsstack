# Knowledge Documentation Index - airs-mcpserver-fs

**Sub-Project:** airs-mcpserver-fs  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-23  
**Status:** Migration Complete - Knowledge Transfer from Legacy Project  
**Total Knowledge Docs**: 2 (1 migrated + 1 current)  
**Migration Source**: airs-mcp-fs project knowledge base

## Overview

This index tracks technical knowledge documentation for the AIRS MCP Server - Filesystem project. Knowledge has been successfully migrated from the legacy `airs-mcp-fs` project and updated for the new architecture.

## Architecture Knowledge

### Legacy Knowledge (Migrated and Preserved)

#### **[Dependency Injection Architecture](./dependency-injection-architecture.md)** *(MIGRATED)*
- **Source**: Migrated from airs-mcp-fs knowledge base
- **Focus**: Trait-based dependency injection patterns, constructor refactoring, testability improvements
- **Status**: Preserved for future refactoring considerations
- **Applicability**: Knowledge preserved - may apply to future airs-mcpserver-fs improvements
- **Migration Date**: 2025-09-23

### Current Knowledge (Production-Ready)

#### **[MCP Server Connection Troubleshooting](./mcp_server_connection_troubleshooting.md)** *(CURRENT)*
- **Status**: Complete - Critical debugging solutions  
- **Knowledge Level**: Expert  
- **Focus**: MCP protocol integration troubleshooting for production deployments

Core troubleshooting knowledge for MCP protocol integration:
- Server lifecycle management (transport.wait_for_completion)
- Capability schema validation (manual JSON construction)
- Protocol message handling (requests vs notifications)
- Client integration patterns (Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector)
- Best practices for capability advertising consistency

## Migration Summary

## Knowledge Quality Standards

### Documentation Standards Applied
- **Migration Traceability**: All migrated knowledge marked with source and date
- **Applicability Assessment**: Current relevance evaluated for each knowledge item
- **Status Tracking**: Clear distinction between legacy, current, and integrated knowledge
- **Cross-References**: Links to related implementation and architecture

### Maintenance Strategy
- **Regular Review**: Quarterly assessment of migrated knowledge relevance
- **Integration Opportunities**: Identify when to apply preserved architectural patterns
- **Knowledge Evolution**: Track how legacy patterns adapt to current architecture
- **Continuous Learning**: Document new knowledge from production experience

## Next Steps

### Knowledge Management
1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess continued relevance of migrated knowledge
2. **Integration Planning**: Plan application of dependency injection patterns when beneficial
3. **New Knowledge Capture**: Document patterns learned from airs-mcpserver-fs operation
4. **Cross-Project Learning**: Share successful patterns with other AIRS projects

### Documentation Expansion
1. **CLI Architecture Knowledge**: Document CLI refactoring patterns (Task 003)
2. **Migration Patterns**: Document successful migration strategies for future projects
3. **Production Operations**: Capture operational knowledge from deployment experience
4. **Security Patterns**: Document security architecture evolution and lessons learned
- Security policy configuration
- Runtime configuration updates

### Error Handling Patterns (Tested)
*Error handling strategies validated in production*
