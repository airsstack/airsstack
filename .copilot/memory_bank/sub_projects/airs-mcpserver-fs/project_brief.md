# Project Brief: AIRS MCP Server - Filesystem

**Sub-Project:** airs-mcpserver-fs  
**Created:** 2025-09-22  
**Status:** Production Ready - Architectural Migration Phase  
**Location:** mcp-servers/airs-mcpserver-fs  
**Legacy:** Migrated from crates/airs-mcp-fs (to be deprecated)  
**Dependencies:** airs-mcp (MCP foundation)

## Vision Statement

**AIRS MCP Server - Filesystem** is a security-first filesystem bridge that enables Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible AI tools to intelligently read, write, and manage files in local development environments. This project represents the architectural evolution of `airs-mcp-fs` into a properly structured MCP server within the broader AIRS ecosystem.

## Strategic Positioning

### Architectural Evolution
- **Legacy Migration**: Clean separation from core AIRS library to dedicated MCP server
- **Ecosystem Alignment**: Proper positioning within future MCP server collection
- **Naming Clarity**: `airs-mcpserver-fs` clearly indicates server implementation role
- **Structural Foundation**: Establishes pattern for additional MCP servers

### Market Opportunity
- **Proven Solution**: Built on fully functional `airs-mcp-fs` with production deployments
- **Enterprise Ready**: Complete security framework with audit logging and compliance
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Verified end-to-end functionality
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-100ms response times with efficient memory management

### Core Value Propositions
- **Universal Filesystem Access**: Standardized MCP interface for all filesystem operations
- **Security-First Design**: Human-in-the-loop approval workflows with configurable policies
- **Advanced Security Framework**: 5-layer security with 97.5/100 security score
- **Performance Excellence**: Production-proven performance characteristics
- **Zero Regression**: All existing functionality preserved during migration

## Project Scope & Requirements

### Migration Requirements
1. **Structural Migration**
   - Move from `crates/airs-mcp-fs` to `mcp-servers/airs-mcpserver-fs`
   - Update all internal references and import paths
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition period

2. **Codebase Adaptation**
   - Update Cargo.toml project name and metadata
   - Ensure all imports and dependencies work correctly
   - Preserve all existing functionality and security features

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update mdbook documentation for new location
   - Create migration guide for existing users
   - Update Claude Desktop integration examples
   - Revise all configuration and setup instructions

4. **Memory Bank Migration**
   - Establish new memory bank sub-project structure
   - Migrate relevant context and patterns from legacy project
   - Create fresh task tracking and progress documentation
   - Maintain architectural knowledge and decisions

### Core Functionality (Preserved from Legacy)
1. **Fundamental Filesystem Operations**
   - Read/write files with automatic encoding detection
   - Directory management (create, list, delete, move, copy)
   - Cross-platform path handling with security validation

2. **Security Framework (Proven)**
   - Human approval workflows for write/delete operations
   - Configurable allowlists/denylists for file paths
   - Threat detection and security scanning
   - Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

3. **MCP Integration (Battle-Tested)**
   - STDIO transport for Claude Desktop compatibility
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling for filesystem operations
   - Tool registration framework aligned with AIRS MCP patterns

### Technical Constraints
- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition for safety and performance
- **Dependencies**: Maintain existing dependency tree for stability
- **Performance**: Preserve sub-100ms response times
- **Security**: Maintain 97.5/100 security score
- **Compatibility**: Ensure Claude Desktop and MCP client compatibility

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Structural Migration (Week 1)
- ✅ New directory structure created under `mcp-servers/`
- ✅ Cargo.toml updated with new project name
- ✅ All imports and dependencies functioning correctly
- ✅ Workspace configuration supports both legacy and new versions
- ✅ Memory bank sub-project established

### Phase 2: Functionality Validation (Week 1-2)
- ✅ All existing functionality works in new location
- ✅ Security framework operational (5-layer security intact)
- ✅ Claude Desktop integration verified
- ✅ All tests passing in new structure
- ✅ Performance characteristics maintained

### Phase 3: Documentation Migration (Week 2-3)
- ✅ mdbook documentation updated for new paths
- ✅ Migration guide created for existing users
- ✅ Claude Desktop setup instructions updated
- ✅ All configuration examples reflect new structure
- ✅ Legacy deprecation notices added

### Phase 4: Legacy Deprecation (Month 2-3)
- ✅ Deprecation warnings added to legacy project
- ✅ All documentation points to new location
- ✅ User transition period completed
- ✅ Legacy structure safely removed

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks (Low)
- **Migration Complexity**: Mitigation through gradual migration strategy
- **Breaking Changes**: Addressed through backward compatibility period
- **Integration Issues**: Minimized by preserving all existing functionality

### Strategic Risks (Minimal)
- **User Disruption**: Managed through clear migration documentation
- **Ecosystem Confusion**: Addressed through clear naming and deprecation strategy
- **Timeline Pressure**: Managed through phased approach with clear milestones

## Integration with AIRS Ecosystem

### Architectural Alignment
- **Proper Separation**: MCP servers separated from core AIRS libraries
- **Naming Convention**: Establishes pattern for future MCP servers
- **Dependency Management**: Clean dependency on core `airs-mcp` library
- **Documentation Structure**: Consistent with AIRS documentation standards

### Future MCP Server Ecosystem
- **Foundation Pattern**: Establishes template for additional MCP servers
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common patterns for security, configuration, and deployment
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Enables `airs-mcpserver-database`, `airs-mcpserver-git`, etc.
- **Consistent User Experience**: Unified patterns across all MCP server implementations

## Migration Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Zero Functional Regression**: All existing features work identically
- **Performance Preservation**: Response times ≤ existing baseline
- **Security Maintenance**: Security score ≥ 97.5/100
- **Test Coverage**: 100% test suite passing

### User Experience Metrics
