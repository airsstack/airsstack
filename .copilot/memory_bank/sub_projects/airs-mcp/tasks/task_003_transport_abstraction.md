# [TASK003] - Transport Abstraction Implementation

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-01  
**Updated:** 2025-08-01

## Original Request
Define and implement the Transport trait for async send/receive/close operations, starting with STDIO transport and preparing for future extensibility (HTTP, WebSocket, TCP).

## Thought Process
- Enables flexible, extensible communication for JSON-RPC.
- STDIO transport is required for immediate integration and testing.
- Future-proofing for additional transport protocols.

## Implementation Plan
- Design Transport trait for async operations.
- Implement STDIO transport with newline-delimited JSON framing and streaming parser.
- Integrate buffer management and thread-safe read/write.
- Prepare for future HTTP, WebSocket, TCP transports.
- Write unit and integration tests for reliability and performance.
