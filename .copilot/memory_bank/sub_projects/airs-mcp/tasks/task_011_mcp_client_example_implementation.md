# [TASK011] - MCP Client Example Implementation

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-09  
**Updated:** 2025-08-09

## Original Request
User requested a practical MCP client example showing real client ↔ server interactions. The goal was to demonstrate the AIRS MCP client library in action with actual protocol communication rather than just server examples.

## Thought Process
Initial approach showed manual JSON-RPC protocol demonstration, but user correctly identified that this bypassed the actual AIRS MCP client library we had built. The task evolved to:

1. **Create SubprocessTransport**: Custom transport implementing the Transport trait for spawning and managing MCP server subprocesses
2. **Use AIRS Client Library**: Demonstrate the high-level McpClient API instead of manual JSON-RPC
3. **Real Interactions**: Show actual client ↔ server communication through the library
4. **Documentation Alignment**: Update README and examples to accurately reflect library usage

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create simple-mcp-client example structure
- [x] Implement SubprocessTransport for server subprocess management  
- [x] Convert from manual JSON-RPC to proper AIRS client usage
- [x] Test all MCP operations (resources, tools, prompts, state management)
- [x] Create comprehensive README documentation
- [x] Update main project documentation to reflect examples

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-09
- **Created simple-mcp-client example**: Complete project structure with proper dependencies
- **Implemented SubprocessTransport**: Custom transport that spawns MCP server subprocesses and implements Transport trait
- **Initial JSON-RPC demo**: Created working protocol demonstration, but user identified this bypassed AIRS library
- **Converted to AIRS client usage**: Replaced manual protocol with McpClientBuilder and McpClient API calls
- **Comprehensive testing**: Verified all MCP operations work through the high-level API
- **Documentation creation**: Created detailed README with project structure, usage examples, and integration patterns
- **Documentation corrections**: Fixed multiple README inconsistencies about manual vs. automatic server management
- **Main project updates**: Updated root README and airs-mcp README to reflect new client example

## Key Achievements

### ✅ **Production-Ready Client Example**
- **SubprocessTransport**: Sophisticated transport implementation managing server lifecycle
- **High-Level API Usage**: Proper demonstration of McpClientBuilder and McpClient
- **Real Protocol Interactions**: Actual client ↔ server communication through AIRS library
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All three MCP capability types (resources, tools, prompts) verified

### ✅ **Documentation Excellence**
- **Project Structure**: Clear explanation of client/server relationship
- **Usage Patterns**: Practical examples for integration with applications
- **Architecture Highlights**: Key AIRS library concepts demonstrated
- **Integration Guidance**: Real patterns for production usage

### ✅ **Technical Innovation**
- **Custom Transport**: Extensible transport layer with subprocess management
- **Process Lifecycle**: Automatic server spawning, communication, and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Production-grade error handling throughout
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type safety for all MCP operations

## Integration Impact

This example significantly enhances the AIRS MCP library by:

1. **Proving Client Capabilities**: Demonstrates the library works for both server AND client use cases
2. **Real-World Patterns**: Shows practical patterns for building MCP client applications
3. **Transport Extensibility**: Proves the transport abstraction works with custom implementations
4. **Documentation Value**: Provides clear guidance for developers wanting to use the client library

The example serves as both a working demonstration and comprehensive tutorial for AIRS MCP client development.
