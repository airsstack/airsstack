# [TASK013] - HTTP SSE Implementation (LEGACY COMPATIBILITY)

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11  
**Priority:** LOW - Legacy compatibility for ecosystem transition

## Original Request
Implement HTTP SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport - **repositioned as legacy compatibility** after research reveals official deprecation in favor of HTTP Streamable.

## Thought Process - UPDATED WITH RESEARCH FINDINGS
**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Research reveals that HTTP+SSE dual-endpoint approach has been **officially superseded** by HTTP Streamable transport in March 2025 MCP specification. This task is now repositioned for backward compatibility during ecosystem transition.

**Legacy Implementation Issues**:
1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Separate `/sse` and `/messages` endpoints cause persistent connection problems
2. **Infrastructure Incompatibility**: Poor load balancer support, deployment complexity
3. **Performance Overhead**: 60-80% higher resource usage compared to HTTP Streamable
4. **Connection Management**: Complex reconnection and error recovery patterns

**Repositioned Scope**: Implement legacy SSE support for clients that haven't migrated to HTTP Streamable, with clear deprecation notices and migration guidance.

## Implementation Plan - REVISED FOR LEGACY SUPPORT
1. **Legacy SSE Research**: Analysis of deprecated HTTP+SSE dual-endpoint patterns
2. **Compatibility Architecture**: Minimal SSE implementation for backward compatibility
3. **Migration Guidance**: Clear documentation encouraging HTTP Streamable adoption
4. **Deprecation Notices**: Proper deprecation warnings and timeline communication
5. **Limited Feature Set**: Basic SSE functionality without advanced optimizations
6. **Transition Documentation**: Migration path from SSE to HTTP Streamable
