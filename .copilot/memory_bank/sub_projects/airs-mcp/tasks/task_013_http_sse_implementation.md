# [TASK013] - HTTP SSE (Server-Sent Events) Implementation

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Implement HTTP SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport for the airs-mcp MCP implementation to enable server-to-client streaming communication using the SSE protocol.

## Thought Process
HTTP SSE transport will provide a unidirectional streaming solution optimized for server-to-client communication patterns. This implementation should:

1. **SSE Protocol Compliance**: Implement full Server-Sent Events specification (RFC 6202) for reliable event streaming
2. **MCP Integration**: Adapt SSE for MCP protocol needs, potentially using SSE for notifications and responses
3. **Bidirectional Workaround**: Consider HTTP POST + SSE combination for full bidirectional MCP communication
4. **Transport Trait Integration**: Follow established Transport trait patterns while accommodating SSE's unidirectional nature
5. **Connection Management**: Handle SSE connection lifecycle, reconnection, and error recovery

The implementation will focus on use cases where server-initiated communication is primary, such as real-time notifications, progress updates, and streaming responses.

## Implementation Plan
1. **SSE Protocol Research**: Deep dive into Server-Sent Events specification and best practices
2. **MCP Protocol Adaptation**: Design how MCP JSON-RPC maps to SSE event streams
3. **Transport Architecture**: Create HttpSseTransport with appropriate abstractions for SSE patterns
4. **Bidirectional Strategy**: Implement HTTP POST + SSE combination for full MCP compatibility
5. **Connection Management**: Add robust connection handling, reconnection, and error recovery
6. **Client Library**: Create SSE client implementation for consuming MCP over SSE
7. **Testing and Examples**: Comprehensive testing with real-world usage examples
