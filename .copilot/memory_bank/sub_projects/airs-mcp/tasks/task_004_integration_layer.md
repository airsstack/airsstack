# [TASK004] - Integration Layer Implementation

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-01  
**Updated:** 2025-08-04

## Original Request
Develop the JsonRpcClient interface, build message routing and handler registration, and ensure end-to-end request/response and notification flows.

## Thought Process
- Centralizes client-side logic for JSON-RPC communication.
- Enables extensibility and robust integration with other systems.
- Supports handler registration for custom message processing.

## Implementation Plan
- Design JsonRpcClient struct integrating CorrelationManager and Transport.
- Implement method calls, notifications, and handler registration.
- Build message processing pipeline: parsing, routing, handler isolation.
- Write end-to-end tests for request/response and notification flows.

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** completed - 100%
