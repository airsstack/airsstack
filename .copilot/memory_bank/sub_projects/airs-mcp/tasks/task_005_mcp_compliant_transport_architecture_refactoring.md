# TASK-005: MCP-Compliant Transport Architecture Refactoring

**Status**: pending  
**Added**: 2025-09-01  
**Updated**: 2025-09-01

## Original Request
Refactor the Transport trait and HTTP transport implementation to align with the official MCP specification, eliminating architectural impedance mismatch and implementing event-driven message handling patterns.

## Thought Process
Research into official MCP specification and TypeScript/Python SDKs revealed that our current Transport trait design is fundamentally misaligned with MCP standards. The official specification uses event-driven message handling with clear separation between transport layer (message delivery) and protocol layer (MCP semantics). Our current sequential receive/send pattern forces artificial correlation mechanisms and creates unnecessary complexity, especially for HTTP transport.

Additionally, analysis of the official MCP documentation revealed that remote servers use diverse authentication methods (OAuth, API keys, username/password combinations), but our current implementation only supports OAuth2. This requires extending our existing `AuthContext` to support multiple authentication methods while maintaining backward compatibility.

Key insights:
1. **Event-Driven vs Sequential**: MCP uses `onmessage` callbacks, not blocking `receive()` calls
2. **Transport/Protocol Separation**: Transport handles delivery, MessageHandler handles MCP protocol logic
3. **Natural Correlation**: JSON-RPC message IDs provide correlation, no oneshot channels needed
4. **Session Management**: Transport-specific, not forced into common interface
5. **Multi-Method Authentication**: MCP servers require OAuth, API keys, and basic auth support
6. **AuthContext Evolution**: Extend existing OAuth2 AuthContext rather than creating new authentication system

This refactoring will eliminate HTTP transport complexity, align with official SDK patterns, and provide comprehensive authentication support for the MCP ecosystem.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Architecture (Week 1)
- Design and implement new MCP-compliant Transport trait interface
- Create JsonRpcMessage type matching MCP specification
- Implement MessageHandler trait for protocol logic separation
- Create MessageContext for session and metadata handling
- Design compatibility layer for migration period

### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 1-2)  
- Implement new transport trait with lifecycle management (start/close)
- Add event-driven message handling via MessageHandler callbacks
- Create session context management for multi-session transports
- Implement transport state tracking (connected/disconnected)
- Add transport type identification for debugging and metrics

### Phase 3: StdioTransport Adapter (Week 2)
- Create compatibility adapter for existing StdioTransport
- Implement event loop to convert blocking receive() to message events
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing stdio-based examples
- Test adapter with current McpServerBuilder integration
- Document migration path for stdio transport users

### Phase 4: HTTP Transport Redesign (Week 2-3)
- Complete rewrite of HttpServerTransport using new interface
- Eliminate oneshot channels and manual correlation mechanisms
- Implement natural HTTP request/response flow with message events
- Add proper session context management for concurrent HTTP requests
- Remove session tracking complexity and artificial correlation
- Integrate with AxumHttpServer using event-driven pattern

### Phase 5: Multi-Method Authentication Enhancement (Week 3)
- Extend existing AuthContext to support multiple authentication methods (OAuth, API keys, username/password)
- Implement authentication strategy pattern for pluggable auth methods
- Create authentication manager for multi-strategy support and fallback chains
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing OAuth2 AuthContext usage
- Add API key and basic authentication strategy implementations
- Update HTTP engines to use AuthenticationManager instead of single OAuth2 config

### Phase 6: McpServerBuilder Integration (Week 3-4)
- Implement McpServer as MessageHandler for protocol logic
- Update McpServerBuilder to work with new Transport interface
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period
- Add support for pluggable MessageHandler implementations
- Update tool, resource, and prompt handling to use new pattern

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation (Week 4)
- Comprehensive unit tests for new Transport trait implementations
- Integration tests for HTTP and stdio transports with new interface
- Performance validation comparing old vs new architecture
- Stress testing for concurrent HTTP sessions and authentication methods
- Security testing for session isolation and multi-method authentication

### Phase 8: Migration and Documentation (Week 4)
- Create migration guides for existing Transport implementations
- Update all examples to use new transport interface and authentication
- Comprehensive documentation for MessageHandler and authentication patterns
- API documentation with usage examples and multi-auth best practices
- Performance benchmarks and comparison with old implementation
