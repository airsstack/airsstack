# [TASK009] - Claude Desktop Integration Troubleshooting

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-07T23:45:00Z  
**Updated:** 2025-08-07T23:45:00Z

## Original Request
User reported that the simple-mcp-server builds successfully and passes all integration tests but fails to integrate with Claude Desktop despite multiple configuration attempts.

## Thought Process
The issue requires systematic troubleshooting using official MCP documentation. Research revealed that our previous integration attempts likely failed due to:

1. **Configuration File Naming**: Using `config.json` instead of required `claude_desktop_config.json`
2. **Logging Violations**: Potential stderr output violating STDIO transport requirements
3. **Missing Debug Workflow**: Skipping MCP Inspector testing phase
4. **Path and Environment Issues**: Not using absolute paths or proper environment setup

The approach is to implement the official MCP debugging methodology: MCP Inspector → Claude Desktop configuration → Integration testing.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Fix Server Logging**: Eliminate all stderr output potential for STDIO transport compliance
2. **Create MCP Inspector Test**: Validate server functionality in isolation
3. **Implement Correct Configuration**: Use proper file path and structure
4. **Create Debugging Scripts**: Based on official MCP documentation
5. **Systematic Integration Testing**: Follow official debugging workflow

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** in_progress - 15%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-07T23:45:00Z
- Completed comprehensive research of official MCP documentation
- Identified critical configuration and logging issues in current implementation
- Removed all existing scripts for clean slate approach
- Created comprehensive integration knowledge base in memory bank
- Ready to begin systematic implementation of proper integration workflow

## Critical Integration Requirements Discovered
- **Config File:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (not `config.json`)
- **STDIO Logging:** Absolutely no stderr output allowed, file-based logging only
- **Debug Workflow:** MCP Inspector testing must precede Claude Desktop integration
- **Paths:** Absolute paths required in configuration
- **Environment:** Limited environment variable inheritance
