# [TASK002] - Correlation Manager Implementation

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-01  
**Updated:** 2025-08-01

## Original Request
Implement the CorrelationManager for bidirectional request/response matching, supporting lock-free concurrency, timeout management, memory safety, and error propagation.

## Thought Process
- Essential for robust concurrent JSON-RPC communication.
- Enables reliable request tracking and response matching.
- Foundation for advanced integration and transport features.

## Implementation Plan
- Design CorrelationManager struct with DashMap and atomic request ID generation.
- Implement request lifecycle: register, send, correlate, resolve, cleanup.
- Integrate per-request and global timeout strategies.
- Propagate structured errors for diagnostics.
- Write unit tests for lifecycle, timeout, and error handling.

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** completed - 100%
