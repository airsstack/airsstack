# [TASK002] - Correlation Manager Implementation

**Status:** abandoned  
**Added:** 2025-08-01  
**Updated:** 2025-01-08

**ABANDONED**: Correlation manager implementation removed during architectural simplification. Direct client-server request-response patterns proven more effective than complex correlation tracking.

## Original Request
Implement the CorrelationManager for bidirectional request/response matching, supporting lock-free concurrency, timeout management, memory safety, and error propagation.

## Thought Process
- Essential for robust concurrent JSON-RPC communication.
- Enables reliable request tracking and response matching.
- Foundation for advanced integration and transport features.

## Implementation Plan
- Design CorrelationManager struct with DashMap and atomic request ID generation.
- Implement request lifecycle: register, send, correlate, resolve, cleanup.
- Integrate per-request and global timeout strategies.
- Propagate structured errors for diagnostics.
- Write unit tests for lifecycle, timeout, and error handling.

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** abandoned - Architectural simplification decision

### 2025-01-08 (TASK ABANDONED - Architectural Simplification)
- **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: Task 002 abandoned based on architectural simplification principles
- **Reasoning**: Complex correlation manager removed in favor of direct client-server request-response patterns
- **Implementation Evidence**: Current client architecture uses direct TransportClient interface without correlation complexity
- **Alignment**: Supports workspace "zero-cost abstractions" principle by eliminating unnecessary complexity
- **Related**: Part of same architectural simplification that led to Task 031 abandonment (TransportBuilder over-abstraction)
- **Current State**: Direct request-response patterns in McpClient proven more effective and maintainable
- **Status**: âœ… **ABANDONED** - Complexity eliminated in favor of simpler, more maintainable architecture
