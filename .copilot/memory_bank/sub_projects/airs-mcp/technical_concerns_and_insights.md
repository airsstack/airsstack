# Technical Concerns and Insights - airs-mcp

**Updated:** 2025-08-06T16:00:00Z
**Context:** Post-benchmark completion analysis

## Technical Concerns Identified & Resolved

### 1. Memory Management in Benchmarking (RESOLVED)

**Issue Discovered:** Initial correlation_performance benchmark caused out-of-memory conditions
- **Root Cause:** Complex concurrent benchmark design with excessive memory allocation
- **Symptoms:** System resource exhaustion, benchmark process hanging
- **Resolution Strategy:** Strategic benchmark removal in favor of correlation_simple
- **Lesson Learned:** Sometimes removal is better than complex fixes; focus on working alternatives

**Technical Decision:**
```rust
// Removed: correlation_performance.rs (problematic)
// Kept: correlation_simple.rs (safe, comprehensive)
```

### 2. Broken Pipe Errors in Terminal Output (INFORMATIONAL)

**Issue Observed:** "Broken pipe" errors when piping benchmark output
- **Root Cause:** Unix pipe behavior when downstream process (head) terminates early
- **Impact:** Harmless - not a code issue, just terminal artifact
- **Resolution:** Run benchmarks without piping to avoid noise
- **Status:** Working as intended, no action needed

### 3. Benchmark API Compatibility (TECHNICAL DEBT)

**Issue Identified:** Some benchmark files need API updates for current implementation
- **Scope:** Non-critical compatibility issues in older benchmark modules
- **Approach:** Professional technical debt management rather than rushed fixes
- **Documentation:** Tracked for systematic future resolution
- **Priority:** Low - core functionality unaffected
