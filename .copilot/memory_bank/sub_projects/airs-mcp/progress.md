## What Works
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Foundation**: Complete message type system with serialization/deserialization
- **Correlation System**: Production-ready CorrelationManager with background cleanup and timeout management
- **Concurrency Support**: Thread-safe correlation handling using DashMap and atomic operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive structured error system with 6 error variants and context
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 34 unit tests + 39 doc tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples and usage patterns
- Initial project setup and architecture documentation
- Requirements and implementation plan extracted from spec/

## Technical Achievements

### TASK001 - Core JSON-RPC Message Types (âœ… COMPLETE)
- JsonRpcMessage trait with unified serialization/deserialization
- JsonRpcRequest, JsonRpcResponse, JsonRpcNotification implementations
- RequestId supporting both numeric and string types
- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance with error handling
- 13 unit tests + 17 doc tests covering all scenarios

### TASK002 - Correlation Manager (âœ… COMPLETE)
- **CorrelationManager**: Complete production implementation
- **Background Cleanup**: Automated expired request cleanup with configurable intervals
- **Timeout Management**: Per-request timeout with global defaults
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of all resources and pending requests
- **Capacity Control**: Configurable limits for pending requests
- **Comprehensive API**: 9 public methods covering all correlation scenarios
- **Error System**: 6 structured error variants with full context
- **Testing**: 7 integration tests covering lifecycle, timeouts, cancellation, concurrency
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs with usage examples

### Architecture
- **Foundation-Up Development**: Clean layered architecture with clear separation
- **Async-First Design**: Built on tokio runtime with proper async patterns
- **Thread Safety**: Lock-free concurrency using DashMap and atomic operations
- **Structured Errors**: thiserror-based error system with context and debugging info

## Development Methodology
Implementation Strategy: Foundation-Up

Phases:
- Week 1-3: JSON-RPC 2.0 + Transport Foundation
- Week 4-5: Protocol Lifecycle + State Management
- Week 6-9: Server Feature Implementation
- Week 10-12: Security + Authorization
- Week 13-14: Client Implementation + Integration

Advanced Implementation Roadmap:
- Phase 1: Core JSON-RPC (Current Focus)
- Phase 2: Correlation Layer (DashMap, timeout, cleanup)
- Phase 3: Transport Abstraction (trait, STDIO, connection lifecycle)
- Phase 4: Integration Layer (JsonRpcClient, routing, handler registration)
- Phase 5: Performance Optimization (zero-copy, buffer pooling, concurrency)
- Phase 6: Advanced Transports (HTTP, WebSocket, benchmarking)

Validation-Driven Development:
- Protocol compliance testing (official MCP test vectors)
- Reference implementation testing (TypeScript SDK compatibility)
- Performance benchmarking (continuous regression detection)
- Security validation (static + dynamic analysis)

Risk Mitigation:
- Incremental validation at each phase
## What's Left to Build
- **Transport Abstraction**: Generic transport layer with STDIO, HTTP, WebSocket support
- **Integration Layer**: High-level client/server abstractions for MCP protocol
- **Performance Optimization**: Zero-copy serialization, buffer pooling, benchmarking
- **Security Framework**: Authentication, authorization, audit logging
- **Protocol Compliance**: MCP-specific message handling and lifecycle management
- **Developer Experience**: Examples, tutorials, and integration guides

## Current Status
- **Phase 1 (JSON-RPC Foundation)**: âœ… COMPLETE
- **Phase 2 (Correlation Layer)**: âœ… COMPLETE  
- **Phase 3 (Transport Abstraction)**: ðŸ”„ READY TO START
- Memory bank updated with latest achievements

## Known Issues
- None currently identified in implemented components
- Early phase, features incomplete
