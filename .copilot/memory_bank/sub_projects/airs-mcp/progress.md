## What Works
- Initial project setup
- README and basic documentation
- Architecture, design, and security knowledge extracted from docs/
- Requirements and implementation plan extracted from spec/

## Development Methodology
Implementation Strategy: Foundation-Up

Phases:
- Week 1-3: JSON-RPC 2.0 + Transport Foundation
- Week 4-5: Protocol Lifecycle + State Management
- Week 6-9: Server Feature Implementation
- Week 10-12: Security + Authorization
- Week 13-14: Client Implementation + Integration

Advanced Implementation Roadmap:
- Phase 1: Core JSON-RPC (Current Focus)
- Phase 2: Correlation Layer (DashMap, timeout, cleanup)
- Phase 3: Transport Abstraction (trait, STDIO, connection lifecycle)
- Phase 4: Integration Layer (JsonRpcClient, routing, handler registration)
- Phase 5: Performance Optimization (zero-copy, buffer pooling, concurrency)
- Phase 6: Advanced Transports (HTTP, WebSocket, benchmarking)

Validation-Driven Development:
- Protocol compliance testing (official MCP test vectors)
- Reference implementation testing (TypeScript SDK compatibility)
- Performance benchmarking (continuous regression detection)
- Security validation (static + dynamic analysis)

Risk Mitigation:
- Incremental validation at each phase
## What's Left to Build
- Full MCP implementation in Rust
- Integration with AIRS and external AI systems
- Complete technical documentation
- Security audit framework implementation
- JSON-RPC request/response/notification handling
- Request correlation manager
- STDIO transport
- Structured error handling
- Performance benchmarks

## Current Status
- Under development
- Memory bank synced with docs and spec knowledge

## Known Issues
- Early phase, features incomplete
