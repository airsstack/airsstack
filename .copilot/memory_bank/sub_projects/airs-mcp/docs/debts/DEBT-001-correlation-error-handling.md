# DEBT-001: Correlation Error Handling Inconsistency

**Status**: Active  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Created**: 2025-08-21  
**Updated**: 2025-08-21  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

## Problem Description
**What is the technical debt?**
- Correlation ID error handling varies inconsistently across transport implementations
- Missing unified error propagation strategy for correlation failures
- HTTP transport handles correlation errors differently than potential future transports
- Impact on current development velocity: Medium (requires workarounds)
- Impact on code maintainability: High (inconsistent patterns)

## Context & Reason
**Why was this debt incurred?**
- Rapid development during Phase 2 HTTP transport implementation
- Focus on core functionality over comprehensive error handling patterns
- Transport trait abstraction discovered during implementation, not design phase
- Time constraints during architectural refactoring

## Current Impact
**How does this debt affect the project today?**
- Development velocity impact: Medium (developers must understand multiple error patterns)
- Code complexity increase: High (each transport implements custom error handling)
- Testing difficulty: Medium (error scenarios require transport-specific test strategies)
- Performance implications: Low (minimal runtime impact)
- Security concerns: Low (errors are logged appropriately)

## Future Risk
**What happens if this debt is not addressed?**
- Projected impact on future development: High (new transports will continue pattern divergence)
- Risk of becoming impossible to fix: Medium (more transports = more refactoring needed)
- Potential for cascading problems: High (error handling affects debugging, monitoring, reliability)

## Remediation Plan
**How should this debt be resolved?**
1. **Design unified correlation error strategy** (4 hours)
   - Define standard error types for correlation failures
   - Establish error propagation patterns across transport boundary
   - Document error handling expectations in transport trait

2. **Implement error handling abstraction** (1 day)
   - Create `CorrelationError` enum with standard variants
   - Implement error conversion traits for transport implementations
   - Add error handling utilities for common patterns

3. **Refactor HTTP transport error handling** (1 day)
   - Update HttpClientTransport to use standard error types
   - Update HttpServerTransport foundation to use standard patterns
   - Migrate existing error handling code

4. **Update tests and documentation** (4 hours)
   - Add comprehensive error handling tests
   - Update transport trait documentation
   - Create error handling examples and best practices

## Code References
**Where is this debt located?**
- `crates/airs-mcp/src/transport/http/client.rs` (lines 150-200, error handling logic)
- `crates/airs-mcp/src/transport/http/server.rs` (foundation error handling)
- `crates/airs-mcp/src/correlation/mod.rs` (correlation ID generation and validation)
- `crates/airs-mcp/src/shared/protocol/transport.rs` (Transport trait error specifications)

## Related Issues
**Links to related tracking**
- GitHub Issues: TBD (to be created during remediation planning)
- Related technical debt items: None identified
- Task management references: Related to Phase 3 server development

## Notes
**Additional context**
- Previous remediation attempts: None (newly identified debt)
- Alternative approaches considered: 
  - Continue with transport-specific error handling (rejected: maintenance burden)
  - Fully generic error handling (rejected: loss of type safety)
- Stakeholder discussions: Needs architecture review with core team
