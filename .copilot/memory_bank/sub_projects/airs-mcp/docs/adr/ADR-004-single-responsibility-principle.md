# Technical Decision: Single Responsibility Principle as Mandatory Standard

**Decision Made**: 2025-08-14T18:45:00Z  
**Context**: HTTP transport module refactoring and architectural optimization  
**Status**: Implemented and enforced  
**Impact**: High - affects all future module design

## Decision

**Establish Single Responsibility Principle as mandatory technical standard for all modules in the airs-mcp crate.**

## Context

During HTTP transport architectural refactoring, we identified that the original `mod.rs` file contained both module organization logic AND redundant test coverage that duplicated functionality already tested in specific implementation modules. This violated the Single Responsibility Principle and created maintenance overhead.

**Problems Identified**:
- Mixed responsibilities within single files
- Redundant test coverage between `mod.rs` and implementation modules
- Unclear module boundaries leading to maintenance complexity
- Code duplication affecting development velocity

**User Request**: 
> "I think we need to refactor this module file. It contains too many things, it will be better to split between client and server transport. I also want you to make this decision as our additional technical standards, that each of module must focus only on single responsibility only"

## Options Considered

### Option A: Partial Refactoring (Rejected)
- Split only HTTP transport without establishing broader standard
- **Pros**: Immediate problem resolution, minimal scope
- **Cons**: Doesn't prevent future architectural drift, inconsistent standards

### Option B: Single Responsibility Principle as Standard (Selected)
- Establish SRP as mandatory technical standard across all modules
- Implement immediate refactoring as exemplary pattern
- **Pros**: Consistent architecture, clear guidelines, improved maintainability
- **Cons**: Requires broader codebase review and potential future refactoring

## Rationale

**Single Responsibility Principle provides crucial architectural benefits**:

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each module has exactly one reason to change
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend code
3. **Better Testability**: Focused tests eliminate redundancy and improve coverage clarity  
4. **Team Development**: Clear separation enables concurrent development without conflicts
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on single concerns per module

**HTTP Transport as Exemplary Implementation**:
- Successfully separated client and server concerns into dedicated modules
- Eliminated redundant test coverage (reduced from 263 to 259 tests)
- Achieved pure module organization in `mod.rs` with clear API coordination
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility through deprecated type alias

## Implementation

### Module Structure Standard
```
module/
├── mod.rs          # API coordination & module organization ONLY
├── implementation.rs # Specific implementation with focused tests
└── other_impl.rs   # Other implementations with their own tests
```

### HTTP Transport Implementation (Reference Pattern)
```
transport/http/
├── mod.rs          # API coordination, re-exports, deprecated aliases
├── client.rs       # HTTP client transport + client-specific tests
├── server.rs       # HTTP server transport + server-specific tests  
├── config.rs       # Configuration types and builders
├── parser.rs       # Request/response parsing utilities
└── buffer_pool.rs  # Buffer pool implementation
```

### Enforcement Rules

1. **One Responsibility Per Module**: Each file addresses exactly one concern
2. **Test Co-location**: Tests live with their implementations, not in coordinator modules
3. **API Coordination**: `mod.rs` files focus purely on module organization and public API
4. **Clear Documentation**: Each module documents its single responsibility explicitly
5. **No Implementation Logic in Coordinators**: `mod.rs` files contain only organization logic

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits (Realized)
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated redundant tests and improved module clarity
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces cognitive load
- **Development Velocity**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- **Testing Efficiency**: Focused test coverage without duplication

### Long-term Benefits (Expected)
- **Consistent Architecture**: All modules follow same organizational principles
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Clear boundaries prevent architectural drift
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple developers can work on different modules concurrently
- **Code Review Efficiency**: Easier to review changes with clear module boundaries

### Metrics
- **Test Count Optimization**: Reduced from 263 to 259 tests by eliminating redundancy
- **Compilation Clean**: All tests pass, zero clippy warnings
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained through deprecated type aliases

## Review Schedule

**Quarterly Review**: Assess adherence to SRP standard across codebase
**Next Review**: 2025-11-14 (3 months)
**Criteria**: Module organization consistency, test co-location compliance, clear responsibility boundaries
