# Active Context: airs-memspec

**Current Work Focus (Updated 2025-08-03):**
- Markdown parser implementation completed successfully (task_007)
- Comprehensive parsing pipeline with YAML frontmatter, section extraction, and multi-format task parsing
- All Day 1 development tasks (1.1-1.4) complete plus architectural refactoring and Day 2.1-2.3 complete
- Ready to begin context correlation system implementation (task_008)

**Recent Changes:**
- ✅ **Task 007 - Markdown Parser Implementation - COMPLETED**:
  - Implemented comprehensive markdown parsing pipeline using pulldown-cmark
  - Added YAML frontmatter extraction with serde_yml integration
  - Created structured data models: MarkdownContent, TaskItem, TaskStatus, FileMetadata
  - Implemented hierarchical section extraction based on heading structure
  - Added multi-format task parsing supporting checkbox lists, index entries, and tables
  - Created intelligent status text normalization handling common variations
  - Fixed parsing conflicts between task formats with proper pattern ordering
  - Added comprehensive test coverage with 6 passing unit tests
  - Created debug tooling (test_markdown_parser example) for validation
  - Integrated with existing FsError system for consistent error handling
- ✅ **Memory Bank Refactoring - COMPLETED**:
  - Successfully refactored monolithic 2,116-line memory_bank.rs into 10 domain-specific modules
  - Implemented clean domain separation: workspace, sub_project, system, tech, monitoring, progress, testing, review, task_management, types
  - Removed unnecessary backward compatibility layer (appropriate for new project)
  - Cleaned up refactoring artifacts (memory_bank_clean.rs, memory_bank_old.rs)
  - Updated mod.rs to expose domain modules directly
  - Applied consistent documentation strategies with functional and conceptual examples
  - Resolved all doc test compilation issues using appropriate rust/ignore patterns
  - Maintained full Serde serialization support and type safety throughout
  - Achieved zero compilation errors with professional code organization
- ✅ **Task 004 - Output Framework Completed**:
  - Implemented comprehensive src/utils/output.rs module with full terminal detection
  - Added OutputConfig with automatic color/terminal width detection
  - Created OutputFormatter with all message types (success, error, warning, info, verbose, essential)
  - Integrated visual elements (headers, separators, progress bars) with terminal adaptation
  - Added colored crate (3.0) and terminal_size (0.4) dependencies
  - Successfully integrated with install command and CLI global flags

**Next Steps:**
- Begin context correlation system implementation (task_008)
- Integrate markdown parser with memory bank navigation for comprehensive content analysis
- Implement current context tracking and workspace-project mapping
- Create correlation algorithms for task status and progress tracking

**Active Decisions:**
- **Markdown Parsing**: pulldown-cmark chosen for robust markdown processing with excellent ecosystem support
- **YAML Handling**: serde_yml integration for structured frontmatter data extraction
- **Task Recognition**: Multi-format support (checkbox, index, table) with intelligent conflict resolution
- **Status Normalization**: Flexible text parsing supporting common status variations and patterns
- **Architecture**: Domain-driven design with focused modules following Single Responsibility Principle
- **Backward Compatibility**: Removed unnecessary compatibility layer for new project simplicity
- **Documentation Standard**: Consistent strategies with functional examples for utils, conceptual for CLI
- **Module Organization**: Direct domain access without abstraction layers for cleaner imports
- **Output Framework**: colored crate chosen for superior terminal detection over manual ANSI
- **Terminal Adaptation**: Responsive formatting with terminal width detection and fallback

**Context Dependencies:**
- Markdown parser now provides structured content extraction foundation for context correlation
- Memory bank architecture provides clean foundation for data model implementation
- All Day 1 tasks (1.1-1.4) completed successfully with comprehensive testing
- CLI framework operational with full output formatting integration
- File system utilities and embedded instruction system ready for use
- Domain modules provide clear separation for future development
- **Integration**: All commands can now use consistent, professional output formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive FsError types with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Verified**: Build success, install functionality, force flag behavior
- **Parsing Pipeline**: Ready for integration with context correlation and command implementations
