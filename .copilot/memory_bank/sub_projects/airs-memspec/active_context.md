# Active Context: airs-memspec

**Current Work Focus (Updated 2025-08-03):**
- Output framework implementation completed successfully (task_004)
- Comprehensive documentation enhancement with 615 lines of well-documented code
- All Day 1 development tasks (1.1-1.4) now 100% complete
- Ready to begin Day 2 development (data models and parsing infrastructure)

**Recent Changes:**
- ✅ **Task 004 - Output Framework Completed**:
  - Implemented comprehensive src/utils/output.rs module with full terminal detection
  - Added OutputConfig with automatic color/terminal width detection
  - Created OutputFormatter with all message types (success, error, warning, info, verbose, essential)
  - Integrated visual elements (headers, separators, progress bars) with terminal adaptation
  - Added colored crate (3.0) and terminal_size (0.4) dependencies
  - Successfully integrated with install command and CLI global flags
- ✅ **Documentation Excellence**:
  - Added extensive module-level documentation with design philosophy
  - Comprehensive method documentation with examples and behavioral contracts
  - Cross-platform compatibility notes and accessibility considerations
  - Performance guidance and usage patterns for all output methods
  - 615 lines of production-ready, well-documented code
- ✅ **Day 1.4 Success Criteria Met**:
  - Output formatting framework handles colors and terminal width detection
  - Color/monochrome support with --no-color flag working correctly
  - Terminal width detection with 80-column fallback implemented
  - All output modes (verbose, quiet, normal) tested and validated

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Day 2 development starting with data model definition (task_005)
- Implement Rust data structures for memory bank parsing
- Add serde integration for YAML/markdown content handling
- Create context and task model structures

**Active Decisions:**
- **Output Framework**: colored crate chosen for superior terminal detection over manual ANSI
- **Documentation Standard**: Comprehensive rustdoc with examples, design philosophy, and usage patterns
- **Terminal Adaptation**: Responsive formatting with terminal width detection and fallback
- **Message Hierarchy**: Clear semantic distinction between message types with consistent emoji usage
- **Quiet Mode Design**: Error messages always shown, essential messages bypass quiet mode

**Context Dependencies:**
- All Day 1 tasks (1.1-1.4) completed successfully with comprehensive testing
- CLI framework operational with full output formatting integration
- File system utilities and embedded instruction system ready for use
- Output framework provides foundation for all future command implementations

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Output System**: Complete terminal-adaptive formatting with 615 lines of documented code
- **Dependencies**: colored (3.0), terminal_size (0.4), thiserror, clap with derive macros
- **Integration**: All commands can now use consistent, professional output formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive FsError types with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Verified**: Build success, install functionality, force flag behavior
