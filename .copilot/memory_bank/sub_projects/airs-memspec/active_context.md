# Active Context: airs-memspec

**Current Work Focus (Updated 2025-08-02):**
- Project initialization and Cargo.toml configuration completed successfully
- Ready to begin CLI framework implementation (task_002)
- Transitioning from foundation setup to core CLI development

**Recent Changes:**
- ✅ Created crates/airs-memspec directory structure
- ✅ Added comprehensive README.md with project documentation  
- ✅ Updated root Cargo.toml workspace configuration with all missing dependencies
- ✅ Fully setup memory bank with all required files
- ✅ Created comprehensive docs/ with architecture documentation
- ✅ **Configured publish-ready Cargo.toml**:
  - AI-focused description: "Streamline AI-assisted development with Multi-Project Memory Bank management and GitHub Copilot integration"
  - Optimized keywords: ["cli", "copilot", "memory-bank", "ai", "workspace"]
  - Independent versioning (0.1.0) for flexible publishing
  - Binary target for CLI installation
  - All crates.io metadata with safety lock
  - Centralized dependency management with workspace inheritance
- ✅ All foundational tasks (task_001) completed at 100%

**Next Steps:**
- Begin CLI framework implementation using clap (task_002)
- Set up basic command structure (install/status/context/tasks)
- Implement argument parsing and help system
- Create modular CLI architecture
- Progress through Day 1.2 development plan

**Active Decisions:**
- **Publishing Strategy**: Independent versioning chosen for flexible release cycles
- **AI Positioning**: Enhanced description and keywords for AI developer discoverability
- **Dependency Management**: Centralized workspace approach with latest stable versions
- **Development Methodology**: Following systematic 4-day development plan with spec-driven workflow
- **Memory Bank Standards**: Maintaining strict Multi-Project Memory Bank compliance

**Context Dependencies:**
- Root workspace properly configured with all required dependencies
- Memory bank operational and synchronized
- Documentation foundation complete with publish-ready metadata
- Ready for CLI development phase with all infrastructure in place

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Dependencies**: All latest stable versions (clap 4.5, serde_yml 0.0.12, pulldown-cmark 0.13, etc.)
- **Versioning**: Independent semantic versioning starting at 0.1.0
- **Publishing**: Complete crates.io configuration with AI-focused metadata
- **Architecture**: Modular design ready for CLI, parser, output, and utility modules
