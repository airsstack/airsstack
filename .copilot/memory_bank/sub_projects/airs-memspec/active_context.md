# Active Context: airs-memspec

**Current Work Focus (Updated 2025-08-03):**
- Custom instructions embedding implementation completed successfully (task_003)
- Install command fully functional with Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions
- Ready to begin output framework implementation (task_004)
- Transitioning from Day 1.3 to Day 1.4 development plan

**Recent Changes:**
- ✅ **Task 003 - Custom Instructions Embedding Completed**:
  - Embedded Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions as static content
  - Implemented comprehensive file system utilities (utils/fs.rs)
  - Complete install command with path handling, validation, and error handling
  - Added template selection system for future extensibility
  - All testing successful: build, install functionality, force flags working
- ✅ **Technical Implementation**:
  - Created embedded/instructions.rs module with static instruction templates
  - Enhanced utils/fs.rs with robust file operations and error types
  - Full install command implementation in cli/commands/install.rs
  - Installation validation and directory structure checking
  - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Day 1.3 Success Criteria Met**:
  - `airs-memspec install --path .test` successfully deploys custom instructions
  - Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions properly embedded (12,929 bytes)
  - Clear success/failure messaging with comprehensive validation

**Next Steps:**
- Begin output framework implementation (task_004)
- Implement color/monochrome output formatting
- Add terminal width detection and adaptation
- Create header and separator generation utilities
- Progress through Day 1.4 development plan

**Active Decisions:**
- **Static Embedding**: Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions embedded as compile-time constants
- **File System Design**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error types and user guidance
- **Install Command**: Default to `.copilot/instructions/` with flexible path override
- **Template System**: Extensible enum-based approach for future instruction variants
- **Validation Strategy**: Installation integrity checking with content verification

**Context Dependencies:**
- All Day 1.1-1.3 tasks completed successfully
- CLI framework operational with working install command
- File system utilities ready for use by other commands
- Embedded instruction system ready for extension

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Module Structure**: embedded/, utils/fs.rs, cli/commands/install.rs fully implemented
- **Dependencies**: thiserror for error handling, std::fs for file operations
- **Install Command**: Full argument parsing, path resolution, and validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive FsError types with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Verified**: Build success, install functionality, force flag behavior
