# Active Context: airs-memspec

**Current Work Focus (Updated 2025-08-04):**
- **PROFESSIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CREATED**: CLI output formatting solution architecture completed
- **Two Implementation Paths Available**:
  - **Quick Fix**: 2-hour hardcoded solution (matches README, creates technical debt)
  - **Professional Solution**: 4-5 day composable layout engine (future-proof, reusable architecture)
- **Comprehensive design document**: task_017_professional_implementation_plan.md with complete technical specifications

**Next Steps:**
- **Decision Required**: Choose implementation approach (quick vs professional)
- **Implementation Strategy**: Detailed 4-phase plan with testing and validation
- **Architecture Ready**: Layout engine, templates, integration plan all specified

**Recent Changes:**
- ✅ **Commands Implementation Pipeline - COMPLETED (2025-08-04)**:
  - task_009: status command - working but basic formatting
  - task_010: context command - working but basic formatting  
  - task_011: tasks command - working but basic formatting
  - task_012: output polish - attempted but insufficient for README examples

- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED (2025-08-04)**: 
  - **Output Formatting Gap**: Current OutputFormatter produces basic console messages
  - **README Promise**: Documentation shows sophisticated structured layouts with:
    - Heavy horizontal lines (`━`) for sections
    - Tabular data with aligned columns
    - Tree structures (`├─`, `└─`) for hierarchical display
    - Rich visual hierarchy and information density
  - **User Impact**: Professional teams expecting documented output will be disappointed
  - **Technical Debt**: HIGH priority - affects credibility and adoption

**Next Steps:**
- **PRIORITY 1**: Address CLI output formatting gap (task_017) - 5-7 days effort
- **Phase 1**: Enhanced OutputFormatter with structured layout engine
- **Phase 2**: Command-specific formatters matching README examples exactly  
- **Phase 3**: Documentation alignment and comprehensive testing

- ✅ **Task 008 - Context Correlation System - COMPLETED**:
  - Implemented comprehensive `src/parser/context.rs` with 700+ lines of correlation pipeline
  - Created `ContextCorrelator` - Main engine for workspace context discovery and correlation
  - Built `WorkspaceContext` - Complete workspace state with sub-project aggregation
  - Implemented `SubProjectContext` - Individual project context with files and task tracking
  - Added `TaskSummary` - Aggregated task status across all projects with progress indicators
  - Created `ProjectHealth` - Health assessment with Critical < Warning < Healthy ordering
  - Implemented context switching functionality with current_context.md file updates
  - Integrated with MemoryBankNavigator for file system discovery
  - Uses MarkdownParser for task and content analysis
  - Applied robust error handling with proper FsError integration
  - All unit tests passing (3/3 context tests + 12/12 total tests)
  - Code quality improvements: proper import organization and error handling patterns

- ✅ **Code Quality Improvements - COMPLETED**:
  - Consolidated imports: moved MarkdownParser to top-level imports across all functions
  - Simplified error handling: replaced verbose `crate::utils::fs::FsError` with direct `FsError` usage
  - Eliminated 4 duplicate local `use` statements for cleaner function organization
  - Improved code readability and maintainability following Rust best practices
  - All compilation and test validation successful after refactoring

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with next development tasks in the pipeline (task_009: status command implementation)
- Implement command handlers using the context correlation system
- Add integration testing for complete workflows

**Active Decisions:**
- **Technical Standards**: Full compliance with workspace-level technical governance
- **Import Organization**: Mandatory 3-layer pattern applied throughout codebase
- **Context Correlation**: Comprehensive approach with workspace-level aggregation and sub-project granularity
- **Error Handling**: Direct FsError usage with proper top-level imports for cleaner code
- **Code Quality**: Consistent application of Rust best practices throughout the codebase
- **Documentation Standard**: Consistent strategies with functional examples for utils, conceptual for CLI
- **Module Organization**: Direct domain access without abstraction layers for cleaner imports
- **Output Framework**: colored crate chosen for superior terminal detection over manual ANSI
- **Terminal Adaptation**: Responsive formatting with terminal width detection and fallback

**Context Dependencies:**
- Workspace technical standards provide foundation for consistent code quality
- Markdown parser now provides structured content extraction foundation for context correlation
- Memory bank architecture provides clean foundation for data model implementation
- All Day 1 tasks (1.1-1.4) completed successfully with comprehensive testing
- CLI framework operational with full output formatting integration
- File system utilities and embedded instruction system ready for use
- Domain modules provide clear separation for future development
- **Integration**: All commands can now use consistent, professional output formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive FsError types with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Verified**: Build success, install functionality, force flag behavior
- **Parsing Pipeline**: Ready for integration with context correlation and command implementations
