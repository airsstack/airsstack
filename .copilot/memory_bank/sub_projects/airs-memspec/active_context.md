**Current Work Focus (Updated 2025-08-03):**
- Context correlation system implementation completed successfully (task_008)
- Complete workspace context management system with comprehensive correlation pipeline
- All Day 1 development tasks (1.1-1.4) plus architectural refactoring and Day 2.1-2.4 complete
- Ready to continue with next development tasks in the pipeline

**Recent Changes:**
- ✅ **Task 008 - Context Correlation System - COMPLETED**:
  - Implemented comprehensive `src/parser/context.rs` with 700+ lines of correlation pipeline
  - Created `ContextCorrelator` - Main engine for workspace context discovery and correlation
  - Built `WorkspaceContext` - Complete workspace state with sub-project aggregation
  - Implemented `SubProjectContext` - Individual project context with files and task tracking
  - Added `TaskSummary` - Aggregated task status across all projects with progress indicators
  - Created `ProjectHealth` - Health assessment with Critical < Warning < Healthy ordering
  - Implemented context switching functionality with current_context.md file updates
  - Integrated with MemoryBankNavigator for file system discovery
  - Uses MarkdownParser for task and content analysis
  - Applied robust error handling with proper FsError integration
  - All unit tests passing (3/3 context tests + 12/12 total tests)
  - Code quality improvements: proper import organization and error handling patterns
- ✅ **Code Quality Improvements - COMPLETED**:
  - Consolidated imports: moved MarkdownParser to top-level imports across all functions
  - Simplified error handling: replaced verbose `crate::utils::fs::FsError` with direct `FsError` usage
  - Eliminated 4 duplicate local `use` statements for cleaner function organization
  - Improved code readability and maintainability following Rust best practices
  - All compilation and test validation successful after refactoring

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with next development tasks in the pipeline
- Implement command handlers using the context correlation system
- Add integration testing for complete workflows

**Active Decisions:**
- **Context Correlation**: Comprehensive approach with workspace-level aggregation and sub-project granularity
- **Import Organization**: Centralized imports at module level for better maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Direct FsError usage with proper top-level imports for cleaner code
- **Code Quality**: Consistent application of Rust best practices throughout the codebase
- **Backward Compatibility**: Removed unnecessary compatibility layer for new project simplicity
- **Documentation Standard**: Consistent strategies with functional examples for utils, conceptual for CLI
- **Module Organization**: Direct domain access without abstraction layers for cleaner imports
- **Output Framework**: colored crate chosen for superior terminal detection over manual ANSI
- **Terminal Adaptation**: Responsive formatting with terminal width detection and fallback

**Context Dependencies:**
- Markdown parser now provides structured content extraction foundation for context correlation
- Memory bank architecture provides clean foundation for data model implementation
- All Day 1 tasks (1.1-1.4) completed successfully with comprehensive testing
- CLI framework operational with full output formatting integration
- File system utilities and embedded instruction system ready for use
- Domain modules provide clear separation for future development
- **Integration**: All commands can now use consistent, professional output formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive FsError types with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Verified**: Build success, install functionality, force flag behavior
- **Parsing Pipeline**: Ready for integration with context correlation and command implementations
