# Decision Records: airs-memspec

This document captures critical technical and architectural decisions made during the development of airs-memspec, providing context, rationale, and impact assessment for future reference.

## Decision 001 - Professional Layout Engine Architecture (2025-08-04)

**Decision**: Implement composable layout engine over quick hardcoded fix for CLI output formatting

**Context**: 
- Critical gap discovered between README documented output (sophisticated structured layouts) and actual implementation (basic console messages)
- Two implementation paths available:
  - Quick Fix: 2-hour hardcoded solution matching README examples but creating technical debt
  - Professional Solution: 4-5 day composable layout engine with future-proof architecture

**Options Evaluated**:
1. **Quick Fix**: Hardcode output templates to match README exactly
   - Pros: Fast delivery, immediate user satisfaction, matches documentation
   - Cons: Technical debt, inflexible, difficult to maintain, no reusability
2. **Professional Solution**: Build composable layout engine with LayoutElement system
   - Pros: Future-proof, reusable, maintainable, extensible, follows SOLID principles
   - Cons: Higher upfront cost, longer implementation timeline

**Rationale**: 
- Chose professional approach based on long-term maintainability and extensibility requirements
- airs-memspec is a foundational tool that will need to evolve with complex output requirements
- Composable architecture aligns with workspace technical standards and SOLID principles
- Investment in proper architecture pays dividends in future feature development

**Impact**:
- Implementation timeline: 4-5 days vs 2 hours (2.5x time investment)
- Code quality: High maintainability vs technical debt
- Future development: Accelerated vs hindered
- User experience: Professional, consistent vs functional but rigid

**Review Date**: 2025-12-01 (evaluate if architecture met expectations)

## Decision 002 - Zero-Warning Policy Enforcement (2025-08-05)

**Decision**: Halt Phase 2 development until 118 clippy warnings resolved

**Context**:
- Phase 1 of task_017 successfully completed with working layout engine
- Discovered 118 clippy warnings across codebase violating workspace Zero-Warning Policy
- User emphasized importance of following technical standards before continuing

**Options Evaluated**:
1. **Continue Development**: Proceed with Phase 2 while warnings exist
   - Pros: Maintain momentum, deliver user-facing value faster
   - Cons: Violates established technical standards, sets precedent for technical debt
2. **Resolve Warnings First**: Systematically fix all warnings before proceeding
   - Pros: Maintains technical standards, ensures code quality, sustainable development
   - Cons: Delays user-facing feature delivery

**Rationale**:
- Zero-Warning Policy is a cornerstone of workspace technical governance
- Technical standards must be consistently enforced to maintain code quality
- Warnings primarily involve format string modernization and minor improvements
- 2-3 hour investment in compliance enables sustainable development practices

**Impact**:
- Short-term: Delays Phase 2 template system by 2-3 hours
- Long-term: Maintains technical excellence and sustainable development velocity
- Code Quality: Ensures modern Rust idioms and best practices
- Team Standards: Reinforces importance of technical governance

**Review Date**: 2025-08-06 (after warnings resolved)

## Decision 003 - Layout Engine Module Structure (2025-08-05)

**Decision**: Implement layout engine as separate module in src/utils/layout.rs

**Context**: 
- Need to integrate professional layout capabilities with existing output framework
- OutputFormatter in src/utils/output.rs handles basic terminal adaptation
- Layout engine provides sophisticated structured formatting capabilities

**Options Evaluated**:
1. **Extend OutputFormatter**: Add layout capabilities to existing output.rs module
   - Pros: Centralized output handling, simpler integration
   - Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle, creates large monolithic module
2. **Separate Layout Module**: Create dedicated src/utils/layout.rs module
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, focused responsibility, better testability
   - Cons: Requires integration coordination between modules

**Rationale**:
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle - OutputFormatter handles terminal adaptation, LayoutEngine handles structured formatting
- Enables focused testing and development of layout capabilities
- Allows independent evolution of terminal adaptation vs layout concerns
- Maintains clean modular architecture consistent with workspace patterns

**Impact**:
- Code Organization: Clear separation between terminal adaptation and layout formatting
- Testing: Independent test suites for each concern
- Maintenance: Easier to modify layout logic without affecting terminal handling
- Reusability: Layout engine can be used independently of OutputFormatter

**Review Date**: 2025-09-01 (evaluate integration effectiveness)
