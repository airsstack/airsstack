## Decision 004 - Optimal Emoticon Policy for CLI Output (2025-08-05)

**Decision**: Implement "just enough emoticons" policy with selective usage across different command types

**Context**: 
- User feedback indicated workspace context command had "too many emoticons" 
- Need to balance professional appearance with visual appeal
- Different commands serve different purposes requiring different visual approaches

**Options Evaluated**:
1. **No Emoticons**: Plain text output only
   - Pros: Maximum professionalism, terminal compatibility
   - Cons: Less engaging, harder to scan quickly
2. **Uniform Emoticons**: Same emoticon policy across all commands
   - Pros: Consistency, predictable user experience
   - Cons: May be inappropriate for some command contexts
3. **Selective Emoticon Policy**: Strategic use based on command purpose
   - Pros: Optimal balance, context-appropriate visual design
   - Cons: More complex to implement and maintain

**Rationale**: 
- Workspace status command retains full emoticons and tree structure (user explicitly likes this)
- Project context commands use clean bullet points without emoticons (professional data display)
- Workspace context uses strategic emoticons only for key elements (üéØ Active Project, üì¶ Sub-Projects, etc.)
- Each emoticon serves semantic purpose and aids visual hierarchy

**Impact**:
- User satisfaction: Achieved desired balance between professional and engaging
- Code maintenance: Clear separation of template types with distinct visual approaches
- Visual hierarchy: Strategic emoticons help users scan and understand output structure
- Professional appearance: Maintains credibility while adding visual interest

**Implementation Details**:
- WorkspaceStatusTemplate: Full emoticons with tree structure (üü¢üü°üî¥ status, ‚îú‚îÄ tree connectors)
- ContextTemplate: Clean bullet points (‚Ä¢) without emoticons  
- WorkspaceContextTemplate: Strategic emoticons (üéØüîóüèóÔ∏è‚ö°üì¶üìãüõ°Ô∏èüß™üìê) for semantic meaning

**Review Date**: 2025-10-01 (evaluate user feedback and usage patterns)

## Decision 003 - Global Separator Color Removal (2025-08-05)

**Decision**: Remove all color formatting from separator elements across the CLI output system

**Context**:
- User requirement: "First thing first, the expected output doesn't have any colors for the lines or separators"
- Existing implementation used blue coloring for separator lines
- Need to maintain professional appearance without colors

**Options Evaluated**:
1. **Conditional Color**: Use colors only when explicitly enabled
   - Pros: Flexibility for different environments
   - Cons: Added complexity, user explicitly wanted no colors
2. **Global Color Removal**: Remove all separator colors uniformly
   - Pros: Meets user requirement exactly, simplifies code
   - Cons: Less visual distinction in color-capable terminals

**Rationale**:
- User explicitly stated requirement for no separator colors
- Simplifies layout engine by removing conditional color logic
- Maintains professional appearance with clean typography
- Consistent with user's preference for clean, professional output

**Impact**:
- Visual design: Clean, professional appearance without color dependency
- Code simplification: Removed conditional color logic from layout engine
- Terminal compatibility: Works consistently across all terminal types
- User satisfaction: Meets explicit requirement

**Review Date**: 2025-09-01 (evaluate if color options should be re-added)

## Decision 001 - Professional Layout Engine Architecture (2025-08-04)

**Decision**: Implement composable layout engine over quick hardcoded fix for CLI output formatting

**Context**: 
- Critical gap discovered between README documented output (sophisticated structured layouts) and actual implementation (basic console messages)
- Two implementation paths available:
  - Quick Fix: 2-hour hardcoded solution matching README examples but creating technical debt
  - Professional Solution: 4-5 day composable layout engine with future-proof architecture

**Options Evaluated**:
1. **Quick Fix**: Hardcode output templates to match README exactly
   - Pros: Fast delivery, immediate user satisfaction, matches documentation
   - Cons: Technical debt, inflexible, difficult to maintain, no reusability
2. **Professional Solution**: Build composable layout engine with LayoutElement system
