# Progress Tracking: airs-memspec

## Current Status (as of 2025-08-02)

### Completed Milestones
- âœ… **Project Initialization**: Workspace structure, crate creation, memory bank setup
- âœ… **Documentation Foundation**: Comprehensive docs with architecture and development plans
- âœ… **Workspace Integration**: Added to root Cargo.toml, proper directory structure

### Currently Working On
- ðŸ”„ **CLI Framework Implementation**: Next task in the development pipeline

### What Works
- Workspace structure follows Multi-Project Memory Bank standards
- Complete documentation with all required architecture files
- Memory bank fully operational with task tracking
- Crate properly integrated into workspace

### What's Left to Build
- CLI framework and command parsing
- Custom instructions embedding system
- Output formatting and terminal handling
- Data model and parsing infrastructure
- All command implementations (status, context, tasks)
- Integration testing and optimization

### Current Focus Areas
- Begin CLI scaffolding with clap framework
- Implement basic command structure and argument parsing
- Set up help and version commands

### Known Issues
- None at this stage - foundation is solid

### Next Major Milestones
1. CLI Framework (Day 1.2)
2. Instructions Embedding (Day 1.3)
3. Output Framework (Day 1.4)
4. Data Model Implementation (Day 2.1)
