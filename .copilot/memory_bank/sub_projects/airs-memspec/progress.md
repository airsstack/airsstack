# Progress Tracking: airs-memspec

## Current Status (as of 2025-08-03)

### Completed Milestones
- âœ… **Project Initialization**: Workspace structure, crate creation, memory bank setup (task_001)
- âœ… **CLI Framework Implementation**: Complete command structure with clap, all commands scaffolded (task_002)
- âœ… **Custom Instructions Embedding**: Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions embedded, install command fully functional (task_003)
- âœ… **Documentation Foundation**: Comprehensive docs with architecture and development plans
- âœ… **Workspace Integration**: Added to root Cargo.toml, proper directory structure
- âœ… **Dependency Management**: All required dependencies added to workspace with latest stable versions
- âœ… **Publishing Configuration**: Complete Cargo.toml setup for crates.io with AI-focused metadata

### Currently Working On
- ðŸ”„ **Output Framework Implementation**: Next task in the development pipeline (task_004)

### What Works
- **Install Command**: Fully functional with embedded Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions
  - `airs-memspec install --path <PATH>` successfully deploys custom instructions
  - Comprehensive path handling, validation, and error messages
  - Force flag for overwriting existing files
  - Template selection system ready for extension
- **File System Utilities**: Robust utils/fs.rs with comprehensive error handling
- **Embedded Instructions**: Static Multi-Project Memory Bank content (12,929 bytes)
- **CLI Framework**: Complete command structure with help system and global options
- **Build System**: `cargo build --bin airs-memspec` succeeds without warnings
- Workspace structure follows Multi-Project Memory Bank standards
- Complete documentation with all required architecture files
- Memory bank fully operational with task tracking
- Crate properly integrated into workspace with centralized dependency management

### What's Left to Build
- Output formatting and terminal handling (task_004)
- Data model and parsing infrastructure (Day 2 tasks)
- All command implementations (status, context, tasks) (Day 3 tasks)
- Integration testing and optimization (Day 4 tasks)

### Current Focus Areas
- Begin output framework implementation with color support detection
- Implement header and separator generation
- Add terminal width detection and adaptation
- Set up monochrome fallback support

### Known Issues
- None at this stage - Day 1.1-1.3 foundation complete and fully tested

### Technical Foundation Completed
- **Install Command**: Complete implementation with validation and testing verified
- **File System Operations**: Comprehensive utilities for directory creation, file writing, validation
- **Embedded Content**: Static instruction templates with extensible enum system
- **Error Handling**: Specific error types with user-friendly messages
- **CLI Framework**: Full command structure with argument parsing and help system
- **Output Framework**: Comprehensive terminal formatting with color detection and adaptation
- **Dependencies**: colored (3.0), terminal_size (0.4), thiserror, clap with workspace inheritance
- **Publishing**: AI-focused metadata, independent versioning, binary target
- **Architecture**: Modular design with embedded/, utils/, cli/commands/ structure
- **Documentation**: Extensive rustdoc with examples, design philosophy, and cross-platform notes

### Next Major Milestones
1. âœ… Output Framework (Day 1.4) - task_004 - **COMPLETED**
2. Data Model Implementation (Day 2.1) - task_005
3. File System Navigation (Day 2.2) - task_006
4. Markdown Parser Implementation (Day 2.3) - task_007

### Day 1 Progress Summary
- **Day 1.1**: âœ… Project Setup & Workspace Integration (task_001)
- **Day 1.2**: âœ… CLI Framework Implementation (task_002)
- **Day 1.3**: âœ… Custom Instructions Embedding (task_003)
- **Day 1.4**: âœ… Output Framework (task_004) - **COMPLETED WITH DOCUMENTATION EXCELLENCE**

### **ðŸŽ‰ DAY 1 DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE - 100% SUCCESS**

All foundational infrastructure completed with comprehensive testing and documentation.
