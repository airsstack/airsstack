# Progress Tracking: airs-memspec

## Current Status (as of 2025-08-02)

### Completed Milestones
- âœ… **Project Initialization**: Workspace structure, crate creation, memory bank setup
- âœ… **Documentation Foundation**: Comprehensive docs with architecture and development plans
- âœ… **Workspace Integration**: Added to root Cargo.toml, proper directory structure
- âœ… **Dependency Management**: All required dependencies added to workspace with latest stable versions
- âœ… **Publishing Configuration**: Complete Cargo.toml setup for crates.io with AI-focused metadata

### Currently Working On
- ðŸ”„ **CLI Framework Implementation**: Next task in the development pipeline (task_002)

### What Works
- Workspace structure follows Multi-Project Memory Bank standards
- Complete documentation with all required architecture files
- Memory bank fully operational with task tracking
- Crate properly integrated into workspace with centralized dependency management
- **Publishing-ready configuration**:
  - AI-focused description and keywords
  - Independent versioning (0.1.0) for flexible release cycles
  - Binary target configured for `cargo install`
  - All crates.io metadata complete with safety lock

### What's Left to Build
- CLI framework and command parsing (task_002)
- Custom instructions embedding system (task_003)
- Output formatting and terminal handling (task_004)
- Data model and parsing infrastructure (Day 2 tasks)
- All command implementations (status, context, tasks) (Day 3 tasks)
- Integration testing and optimization (Day 4 tasks)

### Current Focus Areas
- Begin CLI scaffolding with clap framework
- Implement basic command structure and argument parsing
- Set up help and version commands
- Create modular CLI architecture

### Known Issues
- None at this stage - foundation is solid and publish-ready

### Technical Foundation Completed
- **Dependencies**: All latest stable versions configured with workspace inheritance
- **Publishing**: AI-focused metadata, independent versioning, binary target
- **Architecture**: Modular design ready for CLI, parser, output, and utility modules
- **Documentation**: Complete with data model, system components, features, stack, integration
- **Version Strategy**: Independent versioning (0.1.0) for flexible publishing

### Next Major Milestones
1. CLI Framework Implementation (Day 1.2) - task_002
2. Instructions Embedding (Day 1.3) - task_003
3. Output Framework (Day 1.4) - task_004
4. Data Model Implementation (Day 2.1) - task_005
