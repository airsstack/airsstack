### Currently Working On
- ðŸ”„ **Context Correlation System**: Next task in the development pipeline (task_008)

### What Works
- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Clean domain-driven design with 10 focused modules
  - Domain separation: workspace, sub_project, system, tech, monitoring, progress, testing, review, task_management, types
  - Full Serde serialization support maintained across all modules
  - Professional documentation with consistent strategies applied
  - Zero compilation errors, clean module organization achieved
- **Output Framework**: Complete terminal-adaptive formatting system (task_004)
  - Comprehensive src/utils/output.rs with 615 lines of documented code
  - Terminal detection: color support, width detection, TTY status validation
  - All message types implemented: success, error, warning, info, verbose, essential
  - Visual elements: headers, separators, progress bars with terminal adaptation
  - Integration with CLI global flags (--no-color, --quiet, --verbose) working correctly
- **Markdown Parser**: Comprehensive parsing pipeline for memory bank files (task_007)
  - Complete parser using pulldown-cmark for robust markdown processing
  - YAML frontmatter extraction with serde_yml integration and error handling
  - Structured data models: MarkdownContent, TaskItem, TaskStatus, FileMetadata
  - Hierarchical section extraction based on heading structure with content organization
  - Multi-format task parsing: checkbox lists, index entries, and tables with intelligent conflict resolution
  - Status text normalization handling common variations and patterns
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 6 passing unit tests and debug tooling
  - Integration with FsError system for consistent error handling
- **File System Navigation**: Comprehensive memory bank discovery and validation (task_006)
  - Complete workspace structure discovery with multi-project support
  - Robust validation with graceful error handling and detailed reporting
  - Real-world tested with actual memory bank structures
- **Data Model Foundation**: Domain-driven data structures with full Serde support (task_005)
  - Comprehensive types module with workspace, sub-project, and task models
  - Clean separation of concerns with focused domain modules
- **Install Command**: Fully functional with embedded Multi-Project Memory Bank instructions
  - `airs-memspec install --path <PATH>` successfully deploys custom instructions
  - Comprehensive path handling, validation, and error messages
  - Force flag for overwriting existing files
  - Template selection system ready for extension
- **File System Utilities**: Robust utils/fs.rs with comprehensive error handling
- **Embedded Instructions**: Static Multi-Project Memory Bank content (12,929 bytes)
- **CLI Framework**: Complete command structure with help system and global options
- **Build System**: `cargo build --bin airs-memspec` succeeds without warnings
- Workspace structure follows Multi-Project Memory Bank standards
- Complete documentation with all required architecture files
- Memory bank fully operational with task tracking
- Crate properly integrated into workspace with centralized dependency management

### What's Left to Build
- Context correlation system implementation (Day 2.4)
- All command implementations (status, context, tasks) (Day 3 tasks)
- Integration testing and optimization (Day 4 tasks)

### Current Focus Areas
- Begin context correlation system implementation (task_008)
- Integrate markdown parser with memory bank navigation for comprehensive content analysis
- Implement current context tracking and workspace-project mapping
- Create correlation algorithms for task status and progress tracking

### Known Issues
- Minor doctest failures in documentation examples (non-functional, cosmetic only)
- All core functionality working correctly with comprehensive test coverage

### Technical Foundation Completed
- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Domain-driven design with 10 focused modules providing clean separation of concerns
- **Output Framework**: Complete terminal-adaptive formatting with color support and extensive documentation
- **Install Command**: Complete implementation with validation and testing verified
- **File System Operations**: Comprehensive utilities for directory creation, file writing, validation
- **Embedded Content**: Static instruction templates with extensible enum system
- **Error Handling**: Specific error types with user-friendly messages
- **CLI Framework**: Full command structure with argument parsing and help system
- **Output Framework**: Comprehensive terminal formatting with color detection and adaptation
- **Dependencies**: colored (3.0), terminal_size (0.4), thiserror, clap with workspace inheritance
- **Publishing**: AI-focused metadata, independent versioning, binary target
- **Architecture**: Modular design with embedded/, utils/, cli/commands/ structure
