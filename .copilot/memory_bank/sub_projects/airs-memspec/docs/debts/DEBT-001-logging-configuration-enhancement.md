# DEBT-001: Logging Configuration Enhancement

**ID**: DEBT-001  
**Title**: Logging Configuration Enhancement  
**Status**: Active  
**Priority**: Low  
**Category**: Enhancement  
**Added**: 2025-08-22  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22  

## Location
**File**: `src/cli/mod.rs`  
**Line**: 43  
**Code Context**:
```rust
// TODO: Set up proper logging based on verbose/quiet flags
```

## Description
Current implementation stores logging configuration flags (verbose/quiet) but doesn't set up advanced logging infrastructure. Basic functionality works correctly - missing advanced logging features only.

## Technical Details
**Current State**: Configuration flags are properly captured and stored but not connected to a logging framework.

**Expected Behavior**: Integration with logging framework (env_logger or tracing) to provide different log levels based on CLI flags.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Business Impact**: MINIMAL - core functionality unaffected
- **Technical Impact**: MINIMAL - missing developer convenience feature only
- **User Impact**: NONE - users not affected by absence of debug logging

## Remediation Plan
**Approach**: Implement env_logger or tracing integration with CLI flag mapping

**Estimated Effort**: ~1 hour

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add logging dependency to Cargo.toml
2. Initialize logger in main() based on CLI flags
3. Add appropriate log statements throughout codebase
4. Test verbose/quiet flag behavior

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Verbose flag enables debug-level logging
- Quiet flag suppresses non-error output
- Default behavior remains unchanged
- No performance impact on release builds

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: NONE

**Justification**: No functional impact - purely enhancement opportunity that improves developer experience.

## Dependencies
- No blocking dependencies
- Optional: Choose between env_logger vs tracing ecosystem

## Notes
Originally identified during comprehensive technical debt assessment on 2025-08-05. This represents typical enhancement debt - functionality that improves developer experience but isn't required for core features.

## Related Issues
- None currently
- Future: Consider creating GitHub issue for logging enhancement
