# [task_020] - Instruction Consistency Update

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-08-09  
**Updated:** 2025-08-09

## Original Request
Update custom instructions to resolve format inconsistencies discovered during validation analysis, ensuring instructions accurately reflect the sophisticated validation capabilities already implemented in airs-memspec.

## Thought Process
Critical analysis revealed that while airs-memspec implements exceptional validation features (status format standardization, stale detection, cross-project consistency), the custom instructions contain format conflicts and don't document these capabilities. This creates confusion and the exact issues we recently resolved, despite the tool being robust enough to handle them.

**Key Discovery**: airs-memspec implementation quality EXCEEDS the originally recommended validation features - the tool already handles format variations gracefully via fuzzy parsing and implements comprehensive validation that surpasses expectations.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Standardize Status Formats**: Update both Memory Bank and Multi-Project instructions to use consistent lowercase format matching tool reality
2. **Document Validation Features**: Add comprehensive documentation of validation capabilities already implemented
3. **Remove Duplications**: Clean up duplicate content in multi-project instructions
4. **Add Validation Checklist**: Create mandatory validation checklist reflecting current tool capabilities
5. **Update Formatting Rules**: Ensure all format rules match the sophisticated fuzzy parsing already implemented

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-09
- **TASK CREATED**: Critical instruction consistency analysis complete
- **Subtask 20.1 COMPLETED**: Memory bank updated with comprehensive validation findings
- **Context Switch**: Switched active context from airs-mcp to airs-memspec
- **Discovery Documented**: airs-memspec validation implementation exceeds original recommendations
- **Subtask 20.2 COMPLETED**: Status format standardization across both instruction files
  - Fixed memory-bank.instructions.md: Updated task header, subtasks, stale detection, and filter documentation
  - Fixed multi_project_memory_bank.instructions.md: Updated task header and overall status format
  - All status references now use consistent lowercase format: `pending`, `in_progress`, `complete`, `blocked`, `abandoned`
- **Subtask 20.3 COMPLETED**: Comprehensive validation system documentation added
  - Added MANDATORY VALIDATION SYSTEM section to both instruction files
  - Documented fuzzy parsing, structure validation, automated issue detection
  - Highlighted that these features are already implemented and operational
- **Subtask 20.4 COMPLETED**: Removed duplicate content from multi-project instructions
  - Cleaned up duplicate core files section that was causing confusion
  - Improved readability and consistency
- **Critical Findings**:
  - Status format standardization already perfect via fuzzy parsing
  - Comprehensive validation system already operational  
  - Automated issue detection already implemented
  - Instructions contain format conflicts that tool handles gracefully
- **Subtask 20.5 COMPLETED**: CLI status mapping documentation and validation checklist 
  - Discovered critical CLI vs internal status mapping: `active` → `in_progress`, `completed` → `complete`
  - Updated both instruction files to document CLI user-friendly mapping system
  - Comprehensive validation documentation now complete with all features covered
- **Subtask 20.6 COMPLETED**: Validation and testing of instruction compatibility
  - Verified that airs-memspec continues to work correctly after instruction updates
  - Tested CLI status filtering to understand mapping differences
  - Confirmed that fuzzy parsing handles instruction format variations gracefully
- **TASK 020 MARKED COMPLETE**: All instruction consistency issues resolved
  - Status format standardization: ✅ Complete
  - Validation feature documentation: ✅ Complete  
  - Duplicate content removal: ✅ Complete
  - CLI mapping documentation: ✅ Complete
  - Testing and verification: ✅ Complete
- **Critical Discovery**: CLI uses user-friendly status names (`active`, `completed`) that map to internal format (`in_progress`, `complete`)
- **Next Steps**: Instruction consistency work complete - ready for potential performance optimization or release preparation
