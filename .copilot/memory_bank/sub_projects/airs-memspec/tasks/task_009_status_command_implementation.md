# [task_009] - Status Command Implementation

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-04

## Original Request
Implement status --workspace/project, progress/milestone/blocker display. (Day 3.1)

## Thought Process
A clear status command is vital for tracking progress, surfacing blockers, and communicating milestones to all contributors.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement status --workspace for overview
- Add status --project <name> for project-specific status
- Create progress tracking and milestone display
- Add blocker and objective visualization

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 9.1 | status --workspace | complete | 2025-08-04 | Implemented comprehensive workspace overview with health metrics |
| 9.2 | status --project | complete | 2025-08-04 | Implemented sub-project specific status with task breakdown |
| 9.3 | Progress/milestone display | complete | 2025-08-04 | Implemented advanced progress analytics with milestones, trends, velocity, ETA |
| 9.4 | Blocker/objective visualization | complete | 2025-08-04 | Enhanced blocker detection with impact analysis, resolution suggestions, escalation paths |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-04
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Core Status Display
- Implemented comprehensive status command with both workspace and sub-project modes
- Added workspace health calculation aggregating all sub-project health
- Created task breakdown display with status distribution and icons
- Implemented basic progress metrics calculation (workspace average)
- Added recent activity display across projects
- Integrated with existing ContextCorrelator and OutputFormatter systems
- All subtasks 9.1 and 9.2 completed with enhanced functionality
- Tests passing: 12 unit tests + 8 doc tests
- Status command fully functional with CLI integration

### 2025-08-04 (Later)
- **Phase 2 Complete**: Progress & Milestone Visualization  
- Implemented comprehensive ProgressAnalyzer with advanced analytics
- Added velocity tracking (tasks completed per week) for workspace and projects
- Created milestone detection with completion thresholds (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Implemented progress trend analysis (Accelerating, Steady, Declining, Unknown)
- Added ETA calculations based on velocity and remaining tasks
- Created bottleneck detection for critical health and high blocked task ratios
- Implemented visual progress bars with Unicode characters
- Added comprehensive KPI dashboard (completion, velocity, blocked ratio, active ratio)
- Enhanced detailed mode with milestones, bottlenecks, and KPI sections
- All analytics integrated seamlessly with existing OutputFormatter
- **Ready for Phase 3**: Blocker & Objective Visualization Enhancement

### 2025-08-04 (Phase 3)
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Enhanced Blocker Detection & Visualization
- Implemented sophisticated blocker analysis with multi-factor severity assessment
- Added intelligent impact calculation considering blocked ratio, velocity impact, and timeline impact
- Created context-aware resolution suggestions based on severity and project conditions
- Enhanced escalation recommendations with urgency indicators (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED, URGENT, etc.)
- Implemented detection of dependency chain bottlenecks and velocity bottlenecks
- Added cross-project dependency bottleneck analysis at workspace level
- Enhanced blocked task display with urgency indicators and actionable next steps
- Created visual impact bars and timeline impact assessments
- Added enhanced sorting and prioritization of bottlenecks by severity and impact
- Implemented comprehensive bottleneck categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Added detailed affected task tracking and scope visualization
- Created timeline impact estimation with specific risk assessments
- Enhanced workspace-wide systemic problem detection
- All Phase 3 functionality integrated with existing status command infrastructure
- **Task 009 100% Complete**: All three phases (Core Status, Progress Analytics, Enhanced Blocker Detection) fully implemented
