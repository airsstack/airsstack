**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-04

## Original Request
Implement context --workspace/project, integration points, focus, architectural decisions. (Day 3.2)

## Thought Process
Context commands provide actionable insight into current focus, integration points, and architectural decisions, supporting better collaboration.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement context --workspace for workspace context
- Add context --project <name> for active context display
- Show integration points and constraints
- Display architectural decisions and patterns

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%
