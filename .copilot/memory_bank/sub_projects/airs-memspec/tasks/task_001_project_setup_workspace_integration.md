# [task_001] - Project Setup & Workspace Integration

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-02

## Original Request
Create airs-memspec crate, configure Cargo, set up module structure, and integrate with workspace build system. (Day 1.1)

## Thought Process
Establishing a solid foundation is critical for maintainability and future extensibility. Following AIRS workspace conventions ensures compatibility and smooth integration.

## Implementation Plan
- Create crate under `crates/airs-memspec/`
- Configure `Cargo.toml` with dependencies and metadata
- Set up module structure per AIRS patterns
- Register as workspace member
- Integrate with build system
