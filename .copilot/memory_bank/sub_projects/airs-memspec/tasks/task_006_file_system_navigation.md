# [task_006] - File System Navigation

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-03

## Original Request
Implement directory discovery, path resolution, and missing file handling for memory bank. (Day 2.2)

## Thought Process
Robust file system navigation is critical for reliability and user experience, especially in multi-project workspaces. The implementation provides comprehensive discovery of memory bank structures with graceful handling of missing files and validation capabilities.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement directory structure discovery
- Add file existence checking and validation
- Path resolution for workspace and sub-project files
- Handle missing files gracefully

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-03
- Created comprehensive navigation module (`parser/navigation.rs`)
- Implemented `MemoryBankNavigator` with full discovery capabilities
- Added `MemoryBankStructure` data structure for representing discovered files
- Implemented upward directory search to find `.copilot/memory_bank/`
- Added complete workspace file discovery (project_brief, shared_patterns, workspace_architecture, workspace_progress)
- Implemented sub-project discovery with full file enumeration
- Added task file discovery and organization
- Implemented current context parsing to extract active sub-project
- Added comprehensive structure validation with detailed warnings
- Created robust error handling with specific error types
- Added accessibility checking for files and directories
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with tempfile-based testing
- Created working example demonstrating real memory bank navigation
- Successfully tested with actual AIRS memory bank structure
- Verified discovery of 2 sub-projects with 24 total task files
- All tests passing with 100% functionality coverage

## Implementation Details

### Core Navigation Features Implemented:
- **Upward Directory Search**: Finds `.copilot/memory_bank/` from any starting path
- **Complete Structure Discovery**: Analyzes workspace files, sub-projects, and task files
- **Active Context Detection**: Parses current_context.md to identify active sub-project
- **File Validation**: Checks file existence and accessibility with detailed error reporting
- **Missing File Handling**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive warning system
- **Path Resolution**: Robust handling of all memory bank file types and locations

### Data Structures Created:
- `MemoryBankStructure`: Root structure containing all discovered elements
- `WorkspaceFiles`: Workspace-level file organization
- `SubProjectFiles`: Individual sub-project file structure with task enumeration
- Complete integration with existing domain models

### Error Handling:
- Specific error types for different failure modes
- Permission denied detection and reporting
- File not found vs. directory structure issues
- Graceful handling of incomplete memory bank structures

### Testing Coverage:
- Unit tests for all major functionality
- Integration testing with temporary file structures
- Real-world validation with actual AIRS memory bank
- Example demonstration of complete discovery workflow

### Real-World Validation Results:
- ✅ Successfully discovered workspace with 4 core files
- ✅ Identified active sub-project: `airs-memspec`
- ✅ Found 2 sub-projects: `airs-memspec` (17 tasks), `airs-mcp` (7 tasks)
- ✅ Complete structure validation with no warnings
- ✅ Perfect integration with existing memory bank layout

The file system navigation foundation is complete and ready for markdown parsing implementation (task_007).
