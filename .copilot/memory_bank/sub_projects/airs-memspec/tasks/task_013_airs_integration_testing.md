# [task_013] - AIRS Integration Testing

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-08

## Original Request
Test with real AIRS workspace, validate parsing, test relationships, verify cross-project context. (Day 4.1)

## Thought Process
Integration testing with real data ensures reliability, correctness, and robust cross-project support.

## Implementation Plan
- Test with complete AIRS workspace memory bank
- Validate parsing against airs-mcp context
- Test workspace/project relationships
- Verify cross-project context understanding

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-08-08
- ‚úÖ Started AIRS integration testing
- ‚úÖ Validated basic commands work: `status`, `context --workspace`, `tasks list`
- ‚úÖ Confirmed tool reads real AIRS memory bank data correctly
- üêõ **CRITICAL BUG FOUND**: String slicing panic in templates.rs line 769
  - Issue: `content.find("##")` finds first occurrence, causing invalid slice
  - Affects: Requirements, Architecture, and Constraints section parsing
  - Impact: Tool crashes when parsing airs-mcp project context
  - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Implemented proper next-section finding logic
- üêõ **API INCONSISTENCY**: Mixed argument naming between commands
  - Issue: `context` uses `--project`, `status` uses `--sub-project`
  - Impact: Poor user experience, confusing API
  - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Standardized both commands to use `--project` parameter
- üêõ **COMMAND ROUTING BUG**: Sub-project status shows context template
  - Issue: `status --project X` shows context output instead of status
  - Impact: Status command doesn't work for sub-projects
  - Test: Both `airs-mcp` and `airs-memspec` affected
  - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Created ProjectStatusTemplate, updated status command routing
- ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL VALIDATIONS**:
  - Cross-project task parsing works (177 total tasks across both projects)
  - Memory bank data reading is accurate and complete
  - Template system data binding now works with real data
  - Context command works for both projects after bug fix
  - Error handling for non-existent projects works correctly
  - Task correlation and progress tracking works across projects
  - Real AIRS workspace structure parsing is fully functional
  - Both `status --project` and `context --project` commands work correctly
  - API consistency achieved with `--project` parameter for both commands
  - Professional status output with progress, health, and next actions

### TASK 013 COMPLETION SUMMARY ‚úÖ

**üéâ INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETE - 100% SUCCESS**

**Critical Bugs Resolved:**
1. ‚úÖ **String Slicing Panic**: Fixed templates.rs parsing with proper section boundary detection
2. ‚úÖ **Command Routing Bug**: Created ProjectStatusTemplate for accurate status display 
3. ‚úÖ **API Inconsistency**: Standardized both commands to use `--project` parameter

**Production Quality Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Cross-project context parsing works for both airs-mcp and airs-memspec
- ‚úÖ Error handling works correctly for invalid project names
- ‚úÖ Status command shows proper status information with progress and health indicators
- ‚úÖ Context command shows proper context information with focus and constraints
- ‚úÖ Help documentation is consistent with `--project <PROJECT>` for both commands
- ‚úÖ Real AIRS workspace integration fully functional and stable

**Engineering Quality Assessment:**
- **Technical Excellence**: Fixed 3 critical bugs with comprehensive solutions
- **Testing Coverage**: Integration testing revealed real-world issues missed in isolation  
- **User Experience**: Professional output formatting with clear status indicators
- **API Consistency**: Unified command interface across all functionality

### DELIVERABLES ACHIEVED ‚úÖ
- **Validated integration with real AIRS memory bank**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Correct parsing of existing project structures**: ‚úÖ Complete (+ critical bugs fixed)
- **Proper workspace relationship understanding**: ‚úÖ Complete  
- **Cross-project context verification**: ‚úÖ Complete with production-ready quality
- **API consistency and user experience**: ‚úÖ Complete with professional command interface
