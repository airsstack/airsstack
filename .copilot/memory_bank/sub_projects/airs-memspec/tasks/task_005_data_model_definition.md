# [task_005] - Data Model Definition

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-03

## Original Request
Define Rust data structures for memory bank, implement serde, create context/task models. (Day 2.1)

## Thought Process
A type-safe, well-annotated data model is essential for robust parsing and future extensibility. This task was completed during the memory bank refactoring (task_017) where we implemented comprehensive domain-driven data models.

## Implementation Plan
- Define Rust structs for all memory bank components
- Implement serde serialization/deserialization
- Create workspace, sub-project, and task models

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 5.1 | Define Rust structs | complete | 2025-08-03 | All 10 domain modules implemented |
| 5.2 | Implement serde | complete | 2025-08-03 | Full serialization support across all types |
| 5.3 | Create context/task models | complete | 2025-08-03 | Comprehensive coverage with type safety |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-03
- Task completed during memory bank refactoring (task_017)
- All required data structures implemented across 10 domain modules:
  - `workspace` - Workspace-level configuration and context management  
  - `sub_project` - Individual project management and metadata
  - `system` - System architecture and technical decisions
  - `tech` - Technology context and infrastructure requirements
  - `monitoring` - Observability and monitoring setup
  - `progress` - Progress tracking and metrics
  - `testing` - Testing and quality assurance framework
  - `review` - Code review management
  - `task_management` - Comprehensive task tracking system
  - `types` - Shared enumerations and common types
- Full Serde serialization/deserialization support implemented
- Type-safe representation of all memory bank components achieved
- Cross-module dependencies properly managed
- Zero compilation errors with professional code organization

## Data Model Architecture Achieved

### Core Data Structures Implemented:
- **Workspace**: Root workspace with metadata, shared patterns, current context, sub-projects, snapshots
- **SubProject**: Individual project with metadata, product context, system patterns, tech context, active context, progress, tasks
- **Task Management**: Complete task tracking with subtasks, progress logs, metadata, statistics
- **Progress Tracking**: Working components, work items, issues, milestones, metrics
- **Context Management**: Active context, changes, blockers, historical snapshots
- **System Architecture**: Components, integrations, technical decisions, relationships
- **Technology Context**: Technologies, development setup, constraints, deployment
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, alerting, tracing configurations
- **Testing**: Test types, results, failures, performance, manual testing
- **Review**: Code review information and status tracking

### Serde Integration Features:
- JSON and YAML serialization support via serde
- Complete derive implementation across all types
- Proper field annotations and optional handling
- DateTime serialization with chrono integration
- HashMap and Vec serialization for collections
- Enum serialization with proper variant handling

### Type Safety Features:
- Strong typing with Rust's type system
- Proper error handling and validation
- Cross-module imports with clear boundaries  
- PartialEq implementation for testing and comparison
- Debug and Clone traits for development convenience

The data model foundation is complete and ready for parsing implementation (task_007).
