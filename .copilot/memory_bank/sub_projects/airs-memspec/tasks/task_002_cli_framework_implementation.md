# [task_002] - CLI Framework Implementation

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-02  
**Updated:** 2025-08-02

## Original Request
Implement command structure using clap, define command enums/args, set up global options, help, and version info. (Day 1.2)

## Thought Process
A robust CLI framework is essential for usability and future extensibility. Using clap derive macros ensures maintainable and declarative argument parsing.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement command structure with clap derive
- Define command enums and argument structs
- Set up global options (path, verbose, quiet, no-color)
- Implement help and version info

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** completed - 100%
