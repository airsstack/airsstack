# AIRS Root Project - Active Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-11  
**Current Focus**: Initial documentation structure creation and action plan documentation

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Create comprehensive root-level documentation for the AIRS ecosystem using mdbook, establishing a unified documentation hub that connects all sub-projects and provides technical knowledge management.

### Current Phase
**Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
- Memory bank establishment for root project ✅
- Action plan documentation (in progress)
- Core documentation structure planning

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Document the action plan in tasks system
2. Create core documentation files (foreword.md, overview.md, philosophy_principles.md)
3. Establish directory structure (projects/, technical/, resources/)
4. Update SUMMARY.md with comprehensive navigation
5. Create initial content for all core sections

## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Memory Bank Setup (2025-08-11)
- **Decision**: Created dedicated sub-project for root AIRS documentation
- **Rationale**: Proper context management and task tracking for documentation work
- **Impact**: Enables structured development approach with memory bank system

### Documentation Architecture Decisions (2025-08-11)
- **Decision**: Use layered information architecture (Narrative → Overview → Navigation → Knowledge)
- **Rationale**: Provides clear user journeys for different types of users
- **Impact**: Creates scalable structure that can grow with the project

### Content Strategy Decisions (2025-08-11)
- **Decision**: Focus on storytelling, philosophy, and cross-project knowledge
- **Rationale**: Root docs should provide context that sub-project docs cannot
- **Impact**: Differentiates root docs from detailed implementation documentation

## Current Development Context

### Project Status
- **Memory Bank**: Complete setup with all core files
- **Documentation Structure**: Planned but not yet implemented
- **Content Strategy**: Defined and ready for implementation
- **Technical Setup**: mdbook infrastructure exists, needs content

### Active Work Areas
1. **Task Management**: Setting up action plan in memory bank task system
2. **Content Creation**: Ready to begin creating core documentation files
3. **Structure Implementation**: Ready to create directory structure and navigation

### Pending Decisions
- Specific content depth for each section
- Cross-reference strategy details
- Sub-project integration approach
- Maintenance workflow establishment

## Development Environment State

### Current Setup
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/hiraq/Projects/rstlix0x0/airs`
- **Documentation Directory**: `/Users/hiraq/Projects/rstlix0x0/airs/docs`
- **Memory Bank Context**: `airs` sub-project (newly created)
- **mdbook Status**: Initialized with basic structure

### Available Resources
- Existing sub-project documentation patterns (airs-mcp, airs-memspec)
- Comprehensive README.md with project information
- Memory bank system with established workflows
- Working mdbook setup ready for content

### Current Constraints
- Single maintainer (need sustainable approach)
- Must coordinate with existing sub-project documentation
- Documentation-only project (no code implementation)

## User Needs & Requirements

### Identified User Types
1. **Technical Evaluators**: Need quick understanding of AIRS capabilities
2. **AI-Rust Explorers**: Want to learn from AIRS patterns and philosophy
3. **Contributors**: Need clear contribution guidelines and project understanding

### Content Requirements
- **Foreword**: Compelling narrative about why AIRS exists
- **Overview**: Technical landscape and achievement summary
- **Philosophy**: Design principles and development methodology
- **Cross-Project Knowledge**: Technical insights spanning multiple projects

### Navigation Requirements
- Clear entry points for different user types
- Smooth transitions between overview and detailed content
- Easy discovery of relevant sub-project documentation

## Quality Standards

### Content Quality
- **Accuracy**: All technical information must be accurate and current
- **Clarity**: Content should be accessible to intended audience
- **Consistency**: Style and structure consistent across all sections
- **Completeness**: Each section should comprehensively cover its topic

### User Experience Quality
- **Navigation**: Intuitive information architecture
- **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive design
- **Accessibility**: Content accessible to diverse users
- **Maintenance**: Sustainable update and maintenance processes

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Success (Phase 1)
- Complete documentation structure with all planned sections
- Core content created for foreword, overview, and philosophy
- Working navigation and cross-references
- Successful mdbook build and local testing

### Long-term Success
- Positive user feedback on documentation usefulness
- Sustainable maintenance workflow established
- Regular updates as projects evolve
- Effective contributor onboarding through documentation

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Maintenance Overhead**: Documentation becoming stale without regular updates
2. **Content Duplication**: Overlap with sub-project documentation
3. **User Confusion**: Poor navigation leading to user confusion
4. **Technical Debt**: Structure that becomes difficult to maintain

### Mitigation Strategies
- Clear ownership and update responsibilities
- Well-defined scope boundaries with sub-projects
- User testing and feedback incorporation
- Regular architecture review and refinement

## Communication & Coordination

### Sub-Project Coordination
- Ensure root documentation complements rather than duplicates sub-project docs
- Establish clear linking strategies
- Maintain awareness of sub-project evolution

### User Communication
- Clear documentation purpose and scope
- Feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
- Regular updates on documentation status

## Notes & Observations

### Development Philosophy
- Human architecture, AI implementation approach applies to documentation too
- Memory bank system providing excellent context management for complex documentation project
- Structured approach enabling systematic progress tracking

### Technical Insights
- mdbook providing good foundation for complex documentation projects
- Directory structure approach enabling scalable content organization
- Cross-reference patterns essential for multi-project documentation
