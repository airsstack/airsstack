# AIRS Root Project Brief

**Project Name**: AIRS (AI & Rust Technology Stack)  
**Sub-Project**: Root Project (Workspace-Level Documentation & Architecture)  
**Created**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: Active Development

## Project Purpose

The AIRS root project manages workspace-level documentation, architecture, and coordination between sub-projects. This includes:

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Unified mdbook documentation covering all sub-projects and technical research
2. **Workspace Architecture**: High-level system design and project coordination
3. **Knowledge Management**: Technical research documentation and cross-project insights
4. **Developer Experience**: Onboarding, contribution guides, and development workflows

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Unified Documentation Hub**: Create comprehensive documentation that ties together all AIRS sub-projects
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Document technical research, architectural decisions, and development methodology
- **Developer Onboarding**: Provide clear entry points for new contributors and users
- **Project Storytelling**: Communicate the vision, philosophy, and "why" behind AIRS

### Success Criteria
- Complete mdbook documentation with foreword, overview, and philosophy sections
- Well-organized technical knowledge base
- Clear project navigation and cross-references to sub-project documentation
- Comprehensive getting started and contribution guides

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Root-level documentation structure using mdbook
- Workspace-level architecture documentation
- Cross-project technical knowledge and research
- Developer experience and onboarding materials
- Project philosophy and design principles documentation

### Out of Scope
- Individual sub-project implementation details (handled by respective sub-projects)
- Code implementation (this is documentation-focused)
- Sub-project specific technical documentation (delegated to airs-mcp, airs-memspec, etc.)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Documentation Structure**: Well-organized mdbook with clear navigation
2. **Content Quality**: Comprehensive, accurate, and well-written documentation
3. **Cross-References**: Proper linking to sub-project documentation
4. **Search & Discovery**: Easy navigation and content discovery
5. **Maintenance**: Sustainable documentation maintenance workflow

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Consistency**: Consistent style and structure across all documentation
2. **Accessibility**: Clear language and good information architecture
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend
4. **Performance**: Fast documentation builds and website performance

## Key Stakeholders

- **Primary**: Project maintainer (rstlix0x0)
- **Secondary**: Contributors and users of AIRS ecosystem
- **Tertiary**: Rust and AI development community

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing sub-project documentation (airs-mcp, airs-memspec)
- Workspace README.md content
- Project philosophy and design decisions

### External Dependencies
- mdbook tooling
- Markdown processing capabilities
- Git version control system

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use mdbook for consistency with sub-project documentation
- Must maintain compatibility with existing documentation structure
- Should follow established naming conventions (snake_case)

### Resource Constraints
- Documentation-only project (no code implementation)
- Must be maintainable by single person initially
- Should not duplicate content that exists in sub-projects

## Architecture Overview

```
AIRS Root Documentation
├── Foreword (storytelling, motivation)
├── Overview (technical landscape, achievements)
├── Philosophy & Principles (design methodology)
├── Projects (sub-project overviews with links)
├── Technical Knowledge (research, architecture)
└── Resources (guides, references)
```

## Development Approach

- **Documentation-Driven**: Start with structure, then create comprehensive content
- **Iterative**: Build core sections first, then expand with technical knowledge
- **Cross-Project Integration**: Ensure proper linking and navigation to sub-projects
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize clarity, accuracy, and usefulness over quantity
