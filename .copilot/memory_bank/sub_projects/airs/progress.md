## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Blockers
- None identified - ready to proceed with implementation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Content Depth Balance**: Ensuring appropriate level of detail without duplicating sub-projects
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping documentation current as projects evolve
3. **Cross-Project Coordination**: Maintaining consistency across all documentation
4. **User Experience**: Creating intuitive navigation for complex information

### Risk Mitigation
- Clear scope boundaries defined in project brief
- Sustainable maintenance approach planned
- Regular review and update processes planned
- User testing and feedback integration planned

## Development Insights

### Successful Patterns
- **Memory bank approach**: Providing excellent structure for documentation project management
