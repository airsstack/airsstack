# [task_011] - quality_assurance_review

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-01-27  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Review all content for accuracy and consistency across the entire AIRS documentation ecosystem to ensure professional quality standards.

## Thought Process
With the core content creation complete (Tasks 001-009), we need a comprehensive quality assurance review to ensure:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: All examples, APIs, and references are correct and current
2. **Content Consistency**: Terminology, style, and structure consistent across all documents
3. **Navigation Integrity**: All links and references work correctly
4. **User Experience**: Clear progression and logical flow for different user types
5. **Professional Standards**: Documentation meets production-quality standards

The review will be systematic, covering both root documentation and integration with sub-project docs.

## Implementation Plan
- Systematic review of all documentation files for accuracy and consistency
- Validation of all code examples and technical references
- Link checking and navigation validation
- Style and terminology consistency review
- User experience and flow assessment
- Integration with quality assurance frameworks

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%
