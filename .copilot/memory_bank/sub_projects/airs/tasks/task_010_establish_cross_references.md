# [task_010] - establish_cross_references

**Status:** abandoned  
**Added:** 2025-01-27  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Link to sub-project documentation - create seamless navigation between root documentation and individual project documentation (AIRS-MCP and AIRS-MemSpec docs).

## Thought Process
Cross-referencing would involve creating interconnected navigation links between:
1. Root documentation (/airs/docs/)
2. AIRS-MCP documentation (/airs/crates/airs-mcp/docs/)  
3. AIRS-MemSpec documentation (/airs/crates/airs-memspec/docs/)

This would transform isolated documentation into an interconnected knowledge web, enabling users to seamlessly navigate from overview content to detailed implementation docs and back.

## Implementation Plan
- Analyze current documentation structure across all three levels
- Design bidirectional linking strategy
- Implement cross-references in root docs pointing to sub-project docs
- Add back-references in sub-project docs pointing to root context
- Validate navigation flows and user experience

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** abandoned - 0%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 10.1 | Analyze multi-level documentation structure | not_started | 2025-08-11 | Abandoned - requires additional research time |
| 10.2 | Design cross-reference linking strategy | not_started | 2025-08-11 | Abandoned - solution identified but needs more development |
| 10.3 | Implement root to sub-project links | not_started | 2025-08-11 | Abandoned - deferred for future implementation |
| 10.4 | Implement sub-project to root back-references | not_started | 2025-08-11 | Abandoned - deferred for future implementation |
| 10.5 | Validate navigation and user experience | not_started | 2025-08-11 | Abandoned - deferred pending research completion |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-11
- Task abandoned by user request
- Reason: Requires additional research time for proper implementation
- Status: Solution approach identified but needs more development time
- Decision: Exclude from current documentation project scope
- Impact: Documentation ecosystem remains functional without cross-references
- Future consideration: Can be revisited when research is complete

## Abandonment Rationale
While cross-referencing would enhance the documentation ecosystem, the user has identified that:
1. Additional research time is needed for proper implementation
2. A solution approach has been found but requires more development
3. The current documentation is functional without cross-references
4. This should be excluded from the immediate project scope

The task can be revisited in the future when the research phase is complete and the implementation approach is fully developed.
