**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Create comprehensive table of contents structure in SUMMARY.md that provides clear navigation for all planned content sections and user journey paths.

## Thought Process
The navigation structure needed to support the layered information architecture planned:
- Narrative layer (foreword, philosophy)
- Overview layer (technical landscape)
- Navigation layer (project links)
- Knowledge layer (technical content)

The structure should provide clear entry points for different user types and logical progression through content.

## Implementation Plan
- Update SUMMARY.md with hierarchical structure
- Organize content into logical sections
- Provide clear navigation paths for different user journeys
- Ensure scalability for future content additions
