# [task_001] - Document Action Plan for Root Documentation

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
The user requested to create a comprehensive action plan for implementing the AIRS root documentation project. This includes creating a detailed task breakdown for implementing foreword.md, overview.md, philosophy_principles.md, and the complete directory structure with technical knowledge base.

## Thought Process
Based on our analysis of the existing documentation structure and the comprehensive action plan discussed, we need to create a systematic approach to implementing the root documentation. The approach should:

1. Build on established patterns from sub-project documentation
2. Create unique value through storytelling, philosophy, and cross-project knowledge
3. Establish sustainable maintenance processes
4. Provide clear user journeys for different audience types

The implementation should follow a phased approach: Foundation → Content → Integration → Maintenance.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create core documentation structure (directories and files)
- Update navigation system (SUMMARY.md)
- Establish basic content framework

### Phase 2: Core Content Creation
- Write foreword.md (storytelling and motivation)
- Write overview.md (technical landscape and achievements)
- Write philosophy_principles.md (design philosophy and principles)

### Phase 3: Extended Content Development
- Create project overview files
- Develop technical knowledge base
- Write resource guides

### Phase 4: Integration & Quality
- Establish cross-references to sub-projects
- Quality assurance and validation
- Setup maintenance workflows

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%

- Documented technical constraints and quality requirements

## Detailed Action Plan

### Task 002: Create Core Documentation Structure
**Objective**: Implement the physical directory structure and create placeholder files
**Dependencies**: Current task completion
**Deliverables**:
- `/docs/src/projects/` directory
- `/docs/src/technical/` directory  
- `/docs/src/resources/` directory
- Placeholder files for all planned content

### Task 003: Create Foreword Content
**Objective**: Write compelling narrative about why AIRS exists
**Content Strategy**:
- Personal journey into AI-Rust intersection
- Vision for type-safe AI infrastructure
- Philosophy of human-AI collaboration
- The gap AIRS fills in the ecosystem

### Task 004: Create Overview Content
**Objective**: Provide technical landscape and achievement overview
**Content Strategy**:
- Current project achievements (Claude Desktop integration, MCP implementation)
- Technical architecture at workspace level
- Sub-project relationships and coordination
- Future roadmap and vision

### Task 005: Create Philosophy & Principles Content
**Objective**: Document core design philosophy and development methodology
**Content Strategy**:
- "Human Architecture, AI Implementation" principle
- Rust-first approach for AI infrastructure
- Memory bank system philosophy
- Type safety as foundation for reliable AI tools
- Modular design principles

### Task 006: Update Summary Navigation
**Objective**: Create comprehensive table of contents
**Approach**:
- Hierarchical structure: Narrative → Overview → Projects → Technical → Resources
- Clear user journey paths
- Cross-reference integration points

### Task 007-012: Extended Implementation
- Project overviews for each sub-project
- Technical knowledge base development
- Resource guide creation
- Cross-reference establishment
- Quality assurance processes
- Maintenance workflow setup

## Success Criteria
- Complete documentation structure with all planned sections
- High-quality content for foreword, overview, and philosophy
- Working navigation and cross-references
- Sustainable maintenance approach
- Positive user validation

## Risk Management
- **Content Depth**: Maintain focus on unique value, avoid duplication
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Design for single-maintainer sustainability
- **User Confusion**: Validate navigation with real users
- **Technical Debt**: Regular architecture review and refinement
