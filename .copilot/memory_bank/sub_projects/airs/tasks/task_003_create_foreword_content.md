## Original Request
Write compelling foreword content that tells the story of AIRS - why this project exists, the personal journey, and the vision for type-safe AI infrastructure in Rust.

## Thought Process

- Inspire confidence in the approach and methodology

## Implementation Plan
- Draft personal narrative about AI-Rust intersection journey
