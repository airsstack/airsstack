# [task_009] - create_resource_guides

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-01-27  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Create comprehensive resource guides for user onboarding and contribution - getting started guide and contributing guide.

## Thought Process
The AIRS documentation ecosystem needed practical entry points for different types of users. After completing the technical knowledge base and project overviews, creating comprehensive resource guides was essential to:

1. **User Onboarding**: Provide clear paths for different user types (AI-enhanced teams, Rust+AI projects, documentation teams)
2. **Contribution Framework**: Establish systematic contribution processes aligned with our 6-phase methodology
3. **Complete Documentation Ecosystem**: Bridge the gap between technical content and practical implementation

The approach focused on creating comprehensive, practical guides that connect to the existing technical documentation while providing standalone value.

## Implementation Plan
- Create comprehensive getting started guide with multiple user paths
- Develop detailed contributing guide with workflow integration
- Ensure proper integration with existing documentation structure
- Validate with mdBook build process

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%
