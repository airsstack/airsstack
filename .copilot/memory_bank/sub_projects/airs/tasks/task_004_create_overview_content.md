**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Write comprehensive overview content that provides a technical landscape view of AIRS, current achievements, architecture, and future roadmap.

## Thought Process
The overview should serve as the technical entry point for evaluators and contributors. It needs to:
- Showcase current production achievements (Claude Desktop integration, MCP implementation)
- Explain the technical architecture at workspace level
- Demonstrate how sub-projects work together
- Present a clear roadmap and vision for the future
- Establish technical credibility and project maturity

## Implementation Plan
- Document current production achievements and capabilities
- Explain workspace-level architecture and sub-project relationships
- Present roadmap and future development plans
- Highlight key technical differentiators
- Provide clear pathways to detailed documentation

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%
