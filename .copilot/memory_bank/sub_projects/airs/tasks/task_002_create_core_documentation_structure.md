# [task_002] - Create Core Documentation Structure

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Create the physical directory structure and core documentation files for the AIRS root documentation project. This includes creating the projects/, technical/, and resources/ directories and the main content files (foreword.md, overview.md, philosophy_principles.md).

## Thought Process
The foundation structure needs to establish:
1. Physical directory organization following the planned architecture
2. Core content files that will contain the main narrative and technical content
3. Placeholder structure that supports the planned user journeys
4. Consistency with existing sub-project documentation patterns

The structure should be scalable and maintainable, following snake_case naming conventions established in the memory bank system.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create the three main directories: projects/, technical/, resources/
2. Create core content files: foreword.md, overview.md, philosophy_principles.md
3. Verify directory structure matches planned architecture
4. Prepare for content development in subsequent tasks

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** complete - 100%
