**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Write comprehensive content documenting the core design philosophy and guiding principles that shape AIRS development, including the human-AI collaboration approach.

## Thought Process
The philosophy & principles section should serve as the foundational reference for understanding AIRS approach. It needs to:
- Clearly articulate the "Human Architecture, AI Implementation" principle
- Explain the Rust-first philosophy for AI infrastructure
- Document the memory bank system philosophy and methodology
- Establish quality standards and engineering principles
- Provide guidance for contributors and future development

## Implementation Plan
- Document the core "Human Architecture, AI Implementation" principle
- Explain Rust-first approach and type safety philosophy
- Detail memory bank system methodology and benefits
- Present modular design principles and patterns
- Establish quality standards and development practices
