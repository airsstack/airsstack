# [task_007] - Create Project Overviews

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-11

## Original Request
Create overview files for airs-mcp and airs-memspec that provide strategic synthesis of each project's value proposition, capabilities, and integration within the AIRS ecosystem, with deep links to detailed documentation.

## Thought Process
After analysis and discussion, we determined that copying sub-project documentation would create maintenance overhead and violate the layered information architecture. Instead, we'll create synthesized content that:

1. Provides unique value not found in sub-project docs
2. Explains ecosystem context and integration
3. Uses strategic deep linking to guide users to detailed information
4. Maintains sustainable documentation architecture

The approach balances comprehensive overview with clear pathways to detailed implementation information.

## Implementation Plan
- Create airs_mcp.md with strategic synthesis and deep links
- Create airs_memspec.md with strategic synthesis and deep links
- Focus on ecosystem context and integration value
- Implement progressive disclosure with smart navigation
- Ensure content is maintenance-friendly and sustainable

## Progress Log
### 2025-01-27
- Created task file with strategic synthesis approach
- Developed comprehensive content strategy balancing overview depth with deep linking
- Successfully implemented AIRS-MCP overview content (5,200+ words) with strategic synthesis approach
- Successfully implemented AIRS-MemSpec overview content (5,100+ words) with comprehensive coverage
- Both overviews provide substantial value while maintaining clear pathways to detailed documentation
- **CRITICAL FIX #1**: Corrected all deep links to point to actual documentation files in `/docs/src/` structure
- **CRITICAL FIX #2**: Updated all links from markdown (.md) to generated HTML (.html) files in `/docs/book/` directories
- **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: Removed cross-linking complexity in favor of independent documentation systems
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Replaced deep links with clear mdbook navigation guidance and comprehensive high-level content
- Created documentation guide explaining AIRS documentation ecosystem and sub-project access patterns
- **Status: Complete** - Both project overviews provide comprehensive standalone value with clear guidance for accessing detailed docs
