## Chronological Decision History

*No formal ADRs created yet - documentation decisions were made during iterative development*

## Implicit Decisions Made During Development

### High Impact Documentation Decisions
1. **mdBook Selection** - Chosen over alternatives for technical documentation
2. **Hierarchical Structure** - Multi-level navigation with clear section organization
3. **Separation of Concerns** - Development workflow split into focused documents
4. **Cross-Project Integration** - Workspace-level coordination with sub-project delegation

### Documentation Architecture Decisions
1. **Content Organization** - Philosophy → Overview → Projects → Technical → Resources structure
2. **Developer Experience Focus** - Comprehensive onboarding and contribution workflows
3. **Knowledge Preservation** - Systematic documentation of methodology and decisions
4. **Professional Standards** - High-quality writing and comprehensive coverage

## Future ADR Candidates

### Documentation Evolution Decisions
1. **Multi-Language Support** - If international contributor base develops
2. **Interactive Documentation** - Enhanced tutorials or interactive examples
3. **API Documentation Strategy** - As sub-projects develop public APIs
4. **Community Contribution Workflow** - If external contributions increase significantly

### Workspace Coordination Decisions
1. **Cross-Project Standards Evolution** - As sub-projects mature
2. **Documentation Maintenance Strategy** - Long-term sustainability approach
3. **Knowledge Base Integration** - Connection with external knowledge systems
4. **Documentation Automation** - CI/CD integration for documentation updates

## Decision Impact Analysis

### High Impact Decisions: 0
- None formally documented yet

### Medium Impact Decisions: 0  
- None formally documented yet

### Low Impact Decisions: 0
- None formally documented yet

## Decision Review Schedule

- **Quarterly Review**: Assess documentation architecture effectiveness
- **Annual Review**: Evaluate long-term documentation strategy
- **Project Milestone Reviews**: Assess documentation decisions during major releases

## Notes

The AIRS root project successfully implemented comprehensive documentation without formal ADRs, demonstrating effective iterative decision-making during development. Future architectural decisions should be documented as formal ADRs to preserve decision rationale and enable informed evolution.

Key documentation decisions were made through iterative development and user feedback, resulting in professional, comprehensive documentation architecture. The knowledge categorization structure now provides a framework for capturing future architectural decisions as the project evolves.
