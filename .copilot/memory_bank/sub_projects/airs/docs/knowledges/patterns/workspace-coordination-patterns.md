## Overview
**What is this knowledge about?**

This document captures the coordination patterns and organizational strategies used to manage multiple interconnected sub-projects within the AIRS workspace, including memory bank coordination, cross-project standards, and unified development workflows.

**Why this knowledge is important**: Effective workspace coordination ensures consistency, reduces duplication, enables knowledge sharing, and maintains architectural coherence across all sub-projects as the ecosystem grows.

**Who should read this**: Project leads, architects, and developers working across multiple AIRS sub-projects.

## Context & Background
**When and why was this approach chosen?**

The workspace coordination patterns evolved from the need to manage multiple specialized sub-projects (airs-mcp, airs-memspec, airs-mcp-fs) while maintaining coherent architecture and shared standards.

**Key Coordination Challenges**:
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Critical insights scattered across individual projects
- **Standard Divergence**: Sub-projects developing incompatible patterns
- **Duplication**: Repeated documentation and implementation patterns
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty coordinating cross-project features

**Alternative approaches considered**:
- **Independent Project Management**: Rejected due to integration complexity
- **Monolithic Project Structure**: Rejected due to concern separation needs
- **Multi-Project Memory Bank with Workspace Standards**: Selected for balanced coordination and autonomy

## Technical Details
**How does this work?**

### Memory Bank Coordination Architecture

#### Hierarchical Knowledge Structure

│       ├── technical-debt-template.md
│       ├── knowledge-template.md
│       └── adr-template.md
└── sub_projects/              # Individual project memory banks
    ├── airs-mcp/
    ├── airs-memspec/
    ├── airs-mcp-fs/
    └── airs/
```

#### Cross-Project Context Switching
```rust
pub struct WorkspaceCoordination {
    pub active_context: CurrentContext {
        pub active_project: String,
        pub last_updated: DateTime<Utc>,
        pub coordination_status: CoordinationStatus,
    },
    pub context_switching: ContextSwitching {
        pub read_workspace_files: "Always before sub-project work",
        pub read_sub_project_files: "Complete memory bank for active project", 
        pub update_current_context: "When switching between projects",
    },
    pub knowledge_inheritance: KnowledgeInheritance {
        pub workspace_standards: "Inherited by all sub-projects",
        pub shared_patterns: "Referenced, not duplicated",
        pub project_specific: "Extends workspace foundation",
    },
}
```

### Standards Coordination Patterns

#### Workspace Standards Enforcement
```rust
pub enum StandardsCoordination {
    WorkspaceLevel {
        scope: "Universal rules applicable to all projects",
        examples: ["Import organization", "Time handling", "Error patterns"],
        enforcement: "Mandatory across all sub-projects",
    },
    ProjectLevel {
        scope: "Project-specific implementations of workspace standards",
        examples: ["Domain-specific error types", "Project APIs"],
        enforcement: "Must align with workspace patterns",
    },
    ApplicationLevel {
        scope: "Evidence of standards implementation",
        examples: ["Code examples", "Compliance documentation"],
        enforcement: "Required in all task documentation",
    },
}
```

#### Knowledge Categorization Coordination
```markdown
# Cross-Project Knowledge Management

Standard Documentation Structure (Applied to All Sub-Projects):
├── docs/
│   ├── debts/                 # Technical debt tracking
│   │   └── _index.md         # Debt registry and categorization
│   ├── knowledges/           # Technical knowledge by category
│   │   ├── architecture/     # System design and structure
│   │   ├── patterns/         # Reusable implementation patterns
│   │   ├── performance/      # Optimization and benchmarking
│   │   ├── integration/      # External system integration
│   │   ├── security/         # Security implementation
│   │   ├── domain/           # Business logic and domain expertise
│   │   └── _index.md        # Knowledge registry
│   └── adr/                  # Architecture Decision Records
│       └── _index.md         # Decision chronology

Template Standardization:
- All knowledge documents follow identical template structure
- Consistent categorization enables cross-project knowledge discovery
- Standardized index files support automated tooling and search
```

### Development Workflow Coordination

#### Multi-Project Task Management
```rust
pub struct MultiProjectTaskCoordination {
    pub task_identification: TaskIdentification {
        pub format: "task_[id]_[name].md",
        pub id_scope: "Unique within sub-project",
        pub naming: "snake_case for consistency",
    },
    pub cross_project_dependencies: CrossProjectDeps {
        pub dependency_tracking: "Explicit documentation in task files",
        pub coordination_mechanism: "Workspace progress tracking",
        pub integration_validation: "Cross-project testing protocols",
    },
    pub status_synchronization: StatusSync {
        pub individual_tracking: "Sub-project _index.md files",
        pub workspace_aggregation: "workspace_progress.md coordination",
        pub stale_detection: "Automated 7-day threshold alerts",
    },
}
```

#### Documentation Coordination Workflow
```bash
# Multi-Project Documentation Update Protocol

1. Context Reading Phase:
   - Read workspace/ files for shared standards
   - Read current_context.md for active project
   - Read complete sub-project memory bank

2. Standards Application Phase:
   - Verify workspace standards compliance (§2.1, §3.2, §4.3, §5.1)
   - Document compliance evidence in task files
   - Reference workspace patterns, don't duplicate

3. Cross-Project Validation Phase:
   - Check for similar implementations in other sub-projects
   - Ensure consistency with established workspace patterns
   - Document deviations with clear rationale

4. Memory Bank Update Phase:
   - Update sub-project specific files
   - Update workspace progress if cross-project impact
   - Maintain clear separation between workspace and project scope
```

```

### Standards Reference Pattern
```rust
// Example of workspace standards reference in project documentation

// ✅ CORRECT: Reference workspace standards
/*
Implementation follows workspace standards per shared_patterns.md:
- Import organization (§2.1): 3-layer structure maintained
- Time handling (§3.2): chrono DateTime<Utc> enforced
- Module architecture (§4.3): mod.rs organization patterns
- Zero warnings (workspace/zero_warning_policy.md): All code passes validation
*/

use std::collections::HashMap;  // Layer 1: Standard library
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};    // Layer 2: Third-party crates
use crate::shared::protocol::core::McpMethod;  // Layer 3: Internal modules

// ❌ INCORRECT: Duplicating workspace standards explanation
/*
We use 3-layer import organization because it provides clear separation 
between different types of dependencies, making code more maintainable...
*/
```

### Cross-Project Knowledge Discovery
```bash
# Knowledge Discovery Protocol Across Sub-Projects

# 1. Search workspace-level patterns first
find workspace/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "oauth2\|security" {} \;

# 2. Search across all sub-projects for related knowledge
find sub_projects/*/docs/knowledges/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "oauth2\|security" {} \;

# 3. Check for related architecture decisions
find sub_projects/*/docs/adr/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "security\|auth" {} \;

# 4. Review technical debt for related issues
find sub_projects/*/docs/debts/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "security\|auth" {} \;
```

## Performance Characteristics
**How does this perform?**

### Coordination Efficiency Metrics
- **Context Switching Time**: <30 seconds to fully load new project context
- **Knowledge Discovery**: O(log n) search across organized knowledge structure
- **Standards Validation**: Automated checks complete in <60 seconds
- **Cross-Project Sync**: Minimal overhead with reference-based approach

### Scalability Characteristics
- **Sub-Project Growth**: Linear scaling with standardized structure
- **Knowledge Volume**: Logarithmic access time with categorical organization
- **Team Coordination**: Scales with clear ownership and responsibility patterns
- **Integration Complexity**: Managed through standardized interfaces and documentation

## Trade-offs & Limitations
**What are the constraints and compromises?**

### Coordination Trade-offs
- **Autonomy vs Consistency**: Sub-projects sacrifice some independence for ecosystem coherence
- **Flexibility vs Standards**: Rigid patterns may not suit all project-specific needs
- **Overhead vs Benefits**: Coordination requires additional documentation and process overhead
- **Complexity vs Control**: Multi-project management introduces coordination complexity

### Knowledge Management Compromises
- **Duplication vs Completeness**: Some information must be project-specific despite workspace standards
- **Maintenance Burden**: Keeping cross-references current requires ongoing effort
- **Learning Curve**: New contributors must understand both workspace and project patterns
- **Tool Dependencies**: Coordination relies on memory bank tooling and documentation discipline

## Dependencies
**What does this rely on?**

### Internal Dependencies
- Multi-project memory bank system for knowledge coordination
- Workspace standards enforcement for consistency
- Documentation templates for standardized knowledge capture
- Git workflows for coordination and versioning

### Process Dependencies
- Regular cross-project review and synchronization
- Disciplined adherence to workspace standards
- Active maintenance of cross-references and documentation
- Team coordination for cross-project feature development

### Tooling Dependencies
- Memory bank validation tools for structure integrity
- Automated standards compliance checking
- Cross-project search and discovery capabilities
- Documentation generation and publishing workflows

## Testing Strategy
**How is this tested?**

### Coordination Validation
```bash
# Workspace standards compliance across all projects
for project in sub_projects/*/; do
    echo "Validating $project"
    # Run standards compliance checks
    # Validate knowledge categorization structure
    # Check cross-reference integrity
done

# Cross-project knowledge consistency
# Validate template adherence across all projects
# Check for knowledge duplication or conflicts
# Verify workspace pattern references are current
```

### Integration Testing
```rust
// Cross-project integration validation
pub struct WorkspaceIntegrationTests {
    pub standards_compliance: "All projects pass workspace standards checks",
    pub knowledge_consistency: "No conflicting knowledge across projects", 
    pub cross_references: "All workspace references resolve correctly",
    pub template_adherence: "All documentation follows workspace templates",
}
```

## Common Pitfalls
**What should developers watch out for?**

### Coordination Mistakes
- **Standards Drift**: Allowing sub-projects to develop incompatible patterns
- **Knowledge Duplication**: Repeating workspace information in project documentation
- **Reference Rot**: Cross-project references becoming stale during evolution
- **Context Confusion**: Working on wrong project due to incomplete context switching

### Process Problems
- **Incomplete Context Reading**: Not reading all required workspace and project files
- **Standards Ignorance**: Implementing without checking workspace standards
- **Documentation Lag**: Project changes not reflected in coordination documentation
- **Integration Assumptions**: Assuming compatibility without validation

### Maintenance Issues
- **Cross-Reference Maintenance**: Failing to update references during reorganization
- **Standards Evolution**: Not coordinating workspace standard changes across projects
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Allowing project-specific knowledge to become isolated
- **Process Inconsistency**: Different projects following different coordination processes
