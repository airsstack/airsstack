# Workspace Project Brief

This document defines the overall vision, objectives, architecture, and technical standards for the AIRS workspace. It serves as the foundational reference for all sub-projects and establishes the technical governance framework.

## Vision Statement

**AIRS (AI Reasoning System)** is a comprehensive Rust-based ecosystem for intelligent system integration and workspace management. The project delivers production-ready tools for Model Context Protocol (MCP) client implementation and advanced memory specification systems.

### Core Value Propositions
- **Professional Quality:** Enterprise-grade Rust implementations with comprehensive testing
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with pluggable components
- **Developer Experience:** Intuitive APIs with excellent documentation and tooling
- **Reliability:** Robust error handling with graceful failure recovery
- **Performance:** Efficient async implementations with minimal resource overhead

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **MCP Client Excellence:** Deliver the most robust and feature-complete MCP client in Rust
2. **Workspace Intelligence:** Provide advanced workspace navigation and context correlation
3. **Technical Leadership:** Establish best practices for Rust multi-crate architecture
4. **Community Impact:** Contribute high-quality open-source tools to the Rust ecosystem

### Quality Objectives
- **Code Quality:** Maintain >95% test coverage with zero compilation warnings
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation with working examples for all public APIs
- **Performance:** Sub-millisecond response times for core operations
- **Reliability:** Zero tolerance for memory leaks or undefined behavior
- **Maintainability:** Consistent patterns enabling confident refactoring and extension

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Crate Strategy
**Rationale:** Modular design enables independent development, testing, and deployment of components while maintaining clear architectural boundaries.

**Crate Composition:**
- **airs-mcp:** JSON-RPC MCP client with correlation management
- **airs-memspec:** Workspace memory and context management system

### Core Technical Principles

#### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Business logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules independent of low-level implementations
- **Interface Segregation:** Focused, minimal interfaces for better testability
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component has one well-defined purpose

#### Async-First Design
- **Tokio Runtime:** Consistent async runtime across all components
- **Non-Blocking I/O:** All I/O operations implemented as async operations
- **Backpressure Handling:** Proper flow control and resource management
- **Cancellation Support:** Graceful shutdown and operation cancellation

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Structured Errors:** Rich error context using `thiserror` with debugging information
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful degradation with clear failure boundaries
- **Monitoring Integration:** Error metrics and alerting for production deployment
- **User Experience:** Clear error messages with actionable resolution guidance

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality Standards
```rust
// Mandatory import organization (3-layer pattern)
use std::collections::HashMap;           // Layer 1: std
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};     // Layer 2: third-party
use crate::types::RequestId;             // Layer 3: internal
```

### Documentation Requirements
- **Module Documentation:** Every module includes purpose, responsibilities, and examples
- **Type Documentation:** All public types documented with usage patterns
- **API Documentation:** Function documentation with examples and error conditions
- **Architecture Documentation:** High-level design decisions and patterns

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive testing of individual components (>80% coverage)
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end workflow testing
- **Doc Tests:** All public API examples must compile and execute
- **Property-Based Testing:** Complex logic validation where appropriate

### Performance Standards
- **Memory Efficiency:** Zero unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- **CPU Efficiency:** Algorithmic complexity analysis for core operations
- **Concurrency:** Safe concurrent access patterns with deadlock prevention
- **Resource Management:** Proper cleanup and resource lifecycle management

## Technical Debt Management

### Debt Prevention
- **Design Reviews:** Architectural changes require explicit approval before implementation
- **Code Reviews:** Minimum two approvals for non-trivial changes
- **Technical Debt Documentation:** All shortcuts documented with remediation plans
- **Regular Technical Debt Reviews:** Quarterly assessment and prioritization

### Debt Remediation Process
1. **Identification:** Technical debt identified during development or reviews
2. **Documentation:** Create GitHub issue with impact assessment and remediation plan
3. **Prioritization:** Classify as Critical/High/Medium/Low based on business impact
4. **Tracking:** Regular progress reviews and milestone updates
5. **Resolution:** Systematic remediation with testing and validation

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit:** All tests pass, no clippy warnings, proper formatting
- **Pre-merge:** Code review approval, documentation updates, architectural compliance
- **Pre-release:** Performance benchmarks, security review, deployment readiness

## Development Workflow

### Task Management
- **Epic-Level Planning:** Large features broken into implementable tasks
- **Story-Level Implementation:** Individual tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- **Context Switching:** Proper context preservation between work sessions
- **Progress Tracking:** Regular updates to memory bank and project status

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Clear Interfaces:** Well-defined APIs between team members and components
- **Documentation-First:** Design decisions documented before implementation
- **Incremental Delivery:** Regular delivery of working, tested components
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Technical decisions shared through memory bank updates

### Quality Assurance
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and quality checks
- **Code Coverage Monitoring:** Coverage reports and trend analysis
- **Performance Monitoring:** Benchmark tracking and regression detection
- **Security Scanning:** Regular security analysis and vulnerability assessment

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Code Quality:** >95% test coverage, zero clippy warnings
- **Performance:** Sub-millisecond response times for core operations
- **Reliability:** <0.1% error rate in production usage
- **Maintainability:** <24 hour turnaround for bug fixes

### Project Metrics
- **Feature Completeness:** 100% implementation of defined requirements
- **Documentation Coverage:** All public APIs documented with examples
- **Community Adoption:** GitHub stars, downloads, and community contributions
- **Developer Experience:** Positive feedback on API usability and documentation quality

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity Management:** Regular architecture reviews to prevent over-engineering
- **Performance Degradation:** Continuous benchmarking and performance monitoring
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **Technical Debt Accumulation:** Proactive technical debt management and remediation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development:** Small, testable increments with regular validation
