### Strategic Decisions

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-Crate Strategy:** Enables independent development while maintaining shared standards
- **Async-First Design:** Tokio runtime throughout for scalable concurrent operations
- **Layer Separation:** Clean architecture with domain, application, infrastructure, interface layers
- **Workspace Inheritance:** Centralized dependency and standard management

#### Quality Decisions
- **Testing Philosophy:** Comprehensive unit + integration + doc tests for reliability
- **Error Handling:** Structured errors with rich context using thiserror
- **Documentation Standards:** API documentation with examples for all public interfaces
- **Import Organization:** Mandatory 3-layer pattern for consistency and readability

#### Technical Debt Management
- **Prevention First:** Design reviews and quality gates prevent debt accumulation
- **Proactive Tracking:** GitHub issue integration for debt visibility and remediation
- **Current Critical Issue (2025-08-04):** airs-memspec CLI output formatting gap - HIGH priority technical debt affecting user experience and adoption
- **Classification System:** Architectural, code quality, documentation, testing, performance debt
- **Regular Review:** Quarterly debt assessment and prioritization cycles

## Cross-Project Integration Status

### Component Integration
- **Memory Bank Navigation:** airs-memspec provides workspace intelligence for development workflow
- **JSON-RPC Client:** airs-mcp provides robust MCP client for external integrations
- **Shared Standards:** Both projects inherit workspace-level technical standards
