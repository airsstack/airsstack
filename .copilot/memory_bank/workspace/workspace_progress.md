# Workspace Progress

This file tracks cross-project milestones, status, and strategic decisions for the workspace.

## Major Milestones Achieved

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (COMPLETE)
- **âœ… Technical Standards Framework:** Comprehensive workspace-level governance established
- **âœ… Multi-Crate Architecture:** Clean separation between airs-mcp and airs-memspec
- **âœ… Quality Assurance:** Professional code quality standards with 97 unit tests + 69 doc tests
- **âœ… Import Organization:** 3-layer import pattern applied across 35+ files
- **âœ… Technical Debt Management:** Proactive debt management framework established

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
- **âœ… airs-mcp Foundation:** Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 + Correlation + Transport + Integration layers
- **âœ… airs-memspec Foundation:** Memory bank navigation and context correlation system
- **ðŸ”„ Integration Verification:** Cross-crate integration testing and validation
- **ðŸ”„ Performance Optimization:** Memory efficiency and runtime performance tuning

## Current Workspace Status

### Production-Ready Components
- **airs-mcp:** Complete MCP client with JSON-RPC, correlation, transport, and integration layers
- **airs-memspec:** Workspace intelligence with memory bank navigation and context switching
- **Governance Framework:** Comprehensive technical standards and quality gates
- **Documentation:** Complete API documentation with working examples

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** 166 total tests (97 unit + 69 doc) - 100% pass rate
- **Code Quality:** Zero critical issues, minor clippy suggestions for optimization
- **Documentation Coverage:** Complete API documentation with examples
- **Technical Debt:** **1 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE** - airs-memspec CLI output formatting gap (task_017)

### Strategic Decisions

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-Crate Strategy:** Enables independent development while maintaining shared standards
- **Async-First Design:** Tokio runtime throughout for scalable concurrent operations
- **Layer Separation:** Clean architecture with domain, application, infrastructure, interface layers
- **Workspace Inheritance:** Centralized dependency and standard management

#### Quality Decisions
- **Testing Philosophy:** Comprehensive unit + integration + doc tests for reliability
- **Error Handling:** Structured errors with rich context using thiserror
- **Documentation Standards:** API documentation with examples for all public interfaces
- **Import Organization:** Mandatory 3-layer pattern for consistency and readability

#### Technical Debt Management
- **Prevention First:** Design reviews and quality gates prevent debt accumulation
- **Proactive Tracking:** GitHub issue integration for debt visibility and remediation
- **Current Critical Issue (2025-08-04):** airs-memspec CLI output formatting gap - HIGH priority technical debt affecting user experience and adoption
- **Classification System:** Architectural, code quality, documentation, testing, performance debt
- **Regular Review:** Quarterly debt assessment and prioritization cycles

## Cross-Project Integration Status

### Component Integration
- **Memory Bank Navigation:** airs-memspec provides workspace intelligence for development workflow
- **JSON-RPC Client:** airs-mcp provides robust MCP client for external integrations
- **Shared Standards:** Both projects inherit workspace-level technical standards
- **Context Switching:** Seamless context management across sub-projects

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Task Management:** Comprehensive task tracking across both sub-projects
- **Progress Correlation:** Cross-project dependency and milestone tracking
- **Quality Assurance:** Unified quality gates and review processes
- **Documentation Synchronization:** Consistent documentation patterns and standards

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (NEXT)
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish baseline performance metrics
- **Security Hardening:** Security review and vulnerability assessment
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end workflow validation
- **Deployment Readiness:** Production configuration and monitoring

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion (FUTURE)
- **Additional Transports:** HTTP, WebSocket, and other protocol implementations
- **Client Libraries:** Language bindings and SDK development
- **Community Integration:** Open source preparation and community guidelines
- **Performance Optimization:** Advanced optimization and scaling strategies

## Success Metrics
