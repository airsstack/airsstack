# Technical Debt Management

This document establishes the framework for identifying, tracking, and remediating technical debt across the AIRS workspace. It ensures that technical debt is managed proactively and does not compromise long-term maintainability.

## Technical Debt Classification

### Debt Categories

#### Architectural Debt
- **Definition:** Fundamental design decisions that limit flexibility or performance
- **Examples:** Tight coupling between layers, missing abstraction boundaries
- **Priority:** High - requires architectural review for remediation
- **Tracking:** GitHub issues with `architectural-debt` label

#### Code Quality Debt
- **Definition:** Code that works but violates quality standards or best practices
- **Examples:** Complex functions, missing error handling, inadequate test coverage
- **Priority:** Medium-High - can be addressed incrementally
- **Tracking:** GitHub issues with `code-quality` label

#### Documentation Debt
- **Definition:** Missing or outdated documentation that impacts maintainability
- **Examples:** Undocumented APIs, outdated architecture diagrams, missing examples
- **Priority:** Medium - addressed during feature development
- **Tracking:** GitHub issues with `documentation` label

#### Testing Debt
- **Definition:** Inadequate test coverage or missing test scenarios
- **Examples:** Low test coverage, missing integration tests, flaky tests
- **Priority:** High - directly impacts code reliability
- **Tracking:** GitHub issues with `testing-debt` label

#### Performance Debt
- **Definition:** Known performance issues or suboptimal implementations
- **Examples:** Inefficient algorithms, unnecessary allocations, blocking operations
- **Priority:** Varies - based on impact assessment
- **Tracking:** GitHub issues with `performance` label

## Debt Identification Process

### During Development
```rust
// TODO(DEBT): Document technical debt inline with context
// DEBT: This implementation uses O(n²) algorithm for simplicity
// Impact: Performance degrades with large datasets (>1000 items)
// Remediation: Replace with HashMap-based lookup (O(1))
// Issue: #123
fn inefficient_lookup(items: &[Item], target: &str) -> Option<&Item> {
    // Temporary implementation - needs optimization
}
```

### Code Review Detection
- **Complexity Analysis:** Flag functions >50 lines or >10 cyclomatic complexity
- **Pattern Violations:** Identify deviations from established patterns
- **Performance Red Flags:** Identify potentially expensive operations
- **Security Concerns:** Flag potential security vulnerabilities

### Automated Detection
- **Clippy Integration:** Custom clippy rules for project-specific patterns
- **Coverage Analysis:** Identify areas with insufficient test coverage
- **Dependency Analysis:** Track outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- **Performance Monitoring:** Benchmark regression detection

## Remediation Strategies

### Incremental Remediation
- **Boy Scout Rule:** Leave code better than you found it

- **Test-Driven Remediation:** Add tests before refactoring
- **Documentation-First:** Update documentation during feature work

### Dedicated Remediation Sprints
- **Monthly Debt Sprint:** Dedicated time for technical debt remediation
- **Pre-Release Cleanup:** Address critical debt before major releases
- **Quarterly Architecture Review:** Systematic review of architectural debt
- **Annual Technology Refresh:** Update dependencies and tooling

### Prevention Strategies
- **Design Reviews:** Prevent architectural debt through upfront design
- **Code Review Standards:** Catch quality debt during development
- **Definition of Done:** Include debt assessment in completion criteria
- **Technical Spikes:** Investigate complex problems before implementation

## Quality Gates

### Debt Thresholds
- **Critical Debt:** Zero tolerance - must be addressed immediately
- **High Priority Debt:** Maximum 5 open issues at any time
- **Medium Priority Debt:** Maximum 20 open issues at any time
- **Low Priority Debt:** Tracked but not actively limited

### Review Cycles
- **Weekly:** Review and triage new debt issues
- **Monthly:** Assess debt metrics and remediation progress
- **Quarterly:** Architecture review and debt strategy assessment
- **Annually:** Technology refresh and major debt cleanup

### Escalation Triggers
- **Critical Debt Creation:** Immediate team notification and planning
- **Debt Threshold Breach:** Suspend new feature development until addressed
- **Degrading Metrics:** Root cause analysis and process improvement
- **Security Debt:** Immediate escalation and emergency remediation

## Debt Lifecycle Management

### Creation Phase
1. **Identification:** Debt discovered during development or review
2. **Documentation:** Create GitHub issue with full context
3. **Classification:** Assign category and priority
4. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate business and technical impact

### Active Management Phase
1. **Triage:** Regular review and priority adjustment
2. **Planning:** Include debt remediation in sprint planning
3. **Tracking:** Monitor progress and update estimates
4. **Communication:** Regular stakeholder updates on debt status

### Resolution Phase
1. **Implementation:** Execute remediation plan with proper testing
2. **Validation:** Verify debt resolution and no regression introduction
3. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation
