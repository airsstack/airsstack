## TASK002: Correlation Manager Implementation Plan

### Subtasks Overview
| ID | Description | Status | Dependencies | Estimated Effort |
|----|-------------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| 2.1 | Design CorrelationManager struct | ready | None | Medium |
| 2.2 | Implement request lifecycle methods | ready | 2.1 | High |
| 2.3 | Integrate timeout and cleanup logic | ready | 2.2 | Medium |
| 2.4 | Implement error propagation | ready | 2.3 | Medium |
| 2.5 | Write comprehensive unit tests | ready | 2.4 | High |

### Technical Specifications
**Core Architecture:**
- DashMap<RequestId, PendingRequest> for concurrent request storage
- AtomicU64 for unique request ID generation
- oneshot::Sender/Receiver for request/response correlation
- Background cleanup task for timeout management
- Structured error types with request context preservation

**Performance Requirements:**
- Sub-millisecond correlation latency
- 1000+ concurrent requests support
- Zero memory leaks over 24-hour operation
- Lock-free operations for scalability

**Quality Standards:**
- 100% test coverage for error scenarios
- Property-based testing for concurrency invariants
- Performance benchmarks for latency validation
- Comprehensive documentation with examples

## Development Methodology

### Foundation-Up Strategy
- **Week 1-3:** JSON-RPC 2.0 + Transport Foundation (current phase)
- **Week 4-5:** Protocol Lifecycle + State Management
- **Week 6-9:** Server Feature Implementation
- **Week 10-12:** Security + Authorization
- **Week 13-14:** Client Implementation + Integration

### Validation-Driven Development
- Protocol compliance testing with official MCP test vectors
- Reference implementation compatibility with TypeScript SDK
- Performance benchmarking with continuous regression detection
- Security validation through static and dynamic analysis

### Risk Mitigation
- Incremental validation at each development phase
- Comprehensive testing before integration points
- Memory safety through Rust ownership model
- Structured error handling for operational diagnostics

## Current State Summary

### Achievements âœ…
- Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 foundation implemented and tested
- All production and development dependencies verified
- Latest stable dev-dependency versions integrated
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure established
- Memory bank fully synchronized and documented

### Next Actions ðŸŽ¯
1. Begin TASK002 implementation with subtask 2.1 (CorrelationManager struct design)
2. Follow foundation-up development methodology
3. Implement comprehensive testing alongside development
4. Maintain progress tracking with memory bank updates
5. Validate performance against sub-millisecond latency requirements

### Technical Debt ðŸ“‹
- Workspace dev-dependencies warning (unused manifest key) - low priority
- Documentation enhancement opportunities for advanced patterns
- Future optimization potential for zero-copy operations

## Notes

**Exceptional preparation phase completion** - All dependencies verified, latest versions integrated, comprehensive testing infrastructure ready. The correlation manager represents a critical foundation component that will enable all subsequent transport and integration development. Development velocity expected to be high with robust testing and validation framework in place.

**Ready for immediate TASK002 implementation with full technical confidence.**
