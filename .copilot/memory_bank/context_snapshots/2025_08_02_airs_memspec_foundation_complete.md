# Context Snapshot: airs-memspec Foundation Complete
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02T00:00:00Z
**Active Sub-Project:** airs-memspec

## Workspace Context
- **Vision:** Multi-crate Rust workspace with airs-mcp (Model Context Protocol server) and airs-memspec (CLI tool for memory bank management)
- **Architecture:** Monorepo structure with shared dependencies, workspace-level configuration, and sub-project independence
- **Shared Patterns:** Rust 2021 edition, async-first design with tokio, structured error handling with thiserror/anyhow, comprehensive testing strategy
- **Progress:** airs-mcp established and functional, airs-memspec foundation completed

## Sub-Project Context (airs-memspec)
- **Current Focus:** Project initialization completed, ready for CLI framework implementation (task_002)
- **System Patterns:** Multi-Project Memory Bank integration, Copilot custom instructions management, CLI-driven workflow
- **Tech Context:** Rust 2021, clap for CLI, tokio for async, serde for serialization, colored output formatting
- **Progress:** 
  - ✅ Crate structure created in crates/airs-memspec/
  - ✅ README.md documentation added
  - ✅ Root Cargo.toml updated with workspace integration
  - ✅ Complete memory bank structure installed and operational
  - ✅ Comprehensive docs/ folder with full architecture documentation
  - ✅ All 16 development tasks defined and tracked

## Task Status Summary
- **Completed (1/16):** task_001 (project_setup_workspace_integration) - 100% complete
- **In Progress (1/16):** task_002 (cli_framework_implementation) - Ready to begin
- **Pending (14/16):** All remaining tasks properly queued and documented

## Key Decisions Made
- **Workspace Integration:** Successfully integrated airs-memspec into existing airs workspace
- **Documentation Strategy:** Complete docs-driven approach with markdown file references
- **Development Methodology:** Following systematic 4-day development plan with spec-driven workflow
- **Memory Bank Approach:** Full Multi-Project Memory Bank compliance with task tracking

## Technical Foundation
- **Dependencies:** All workspace dependencies available (tokio, serde, clap, etc.)
- **Structure:** Modular crate design ready for CLI, parser, output, and utility modules
- **Documentation:** Complete architecture docs including data model, system components, features, stack, and integration
- **Testing Strategy:** Framework established for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

## Development Pipeline
- **Day 1 Remaining:** CLI framework (task_002), instructions embedding (task_003), output framework (task_004)
- **Day 2 Focus:** Data model, filesystem navigation, markdown parsing, context correlation
- **Day 3 Focus:** Command implementations (status, context, tasks), output polish
- **Day 4 Focus:** Integration testing, error handling, performance optimization, documentation

## Quality Assurance
- **Code Standards:** SOLID principles, clean architecture, comprehensive error handling
- **Documentation:** All decisions documented, memory bank maintained, progress tracked
- **Testing:** Automated testing strategy defined, ready for implementation
- **Performance:** Optimization planned for Day 4, baseline metrics to be established

## Integration Points
- **GitHub Copilot:** Custom instructions management and context switching
- **Multi-Project Memory Bank:** Full compliance with workspace and sub-project patterns
- **airs Workspace:** Proper integration with existing airs-mcp crate
- **Development Workflow:** Spec-driven development with comprehensive documentation

## Notes
- Foundation phase completed successfully with 100% task completion
- All documentation properly referenced with markdown file paths
- Memory bank operational and synchronized with actual project state
- Ready to proceed with CLI framework implementation
- No blockers or technical debt identified
- Workspace structure validates against all architectural requirements

## Files and References
- **Memory Bank:** `.copilot/memory_bank/sub_projects/airs-memspec/`
- **Project Source:** `crates/airs-memspec/`
- **Documentation:** `crates/airs-memspec/docs/src/`
- **Workspace Config:** `Cargo.toml` (root level)
- **Architecture Docs:** Complete set in `docs/src/architecture/`
- **Development Plans:** `docs/src/development/day_*.md`

## Next Session Priority
Begin task_002 (CLI framework implementation) with clap setup, command structure, and basic argument parsing.
