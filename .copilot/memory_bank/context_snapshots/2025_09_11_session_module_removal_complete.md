# Context Snapshot: Session Module Removal Complete
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-11T15:00:00Z
**Active Sub-Project:** airs-mcp

## Workspace Context
- **Vision**: AIRS workspace providing enterprise-grade MCP implementation
- **Architecture**: Multi-crate workspace with clean separation of concerns
- **Standards**: Workspace standards enforcement with zero-warning policy
- **Current Status**: Architectural debt elimination phase complete

## Sub-Project Context - airs-mcp
- **Current Focus**: Architectural cleanup completion - session module removal
- **System Architecture**: ADR-012 Generic MessageHandler pattern fully implemented
- **Transport Layer**: Simplified HTTP transports aligned with MCP stateless design
- **API Simplification**: AxumHttpServer constructor reduced from 4 to 3 parameters

## Major Achievements

### Session Module Removal (2025-09-11)
- **Removed**: `transport/adapters/http/session.rs` (400+ lines of complex session management)
- **Eliminated**: DashMap-based session storage with background cleanup threads
- **Simplified**: Session ID handling to simple UUID generation from headers
- **Updated**: All integration tests and examples to use simplified constructors
- **Result**: Full alignment with MCP stateless JSON-RPC protocol design

### Total Architectural Debt Eliminated
- **Session Module**: 400+ lines of over-engineered session management
- **Correlation Module**: 1,200+ lines of redundant request correlation (previously removed)
- **Legacy Transport**: 2,900+ lines of deprecated transport implementations (previously removed)
- **Total Impact**: 4,500+ lines of architectural debt eliminated

## Quality Validation
- **Unit Tests**: All 322 tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: All 32 tests passing  
- **Examples**: All examples compiling and functional
- **Compilation**: Zero warnings or errors across entire package
- **MCP Compliance**: Full adherence to stateless protocol design

## Technical Status
- **Architecture**: Clean, simplified, aligned with MCP protocol principles
- **API Surface**: Developer-friendly with fewer parameters and clearer responsibilities
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary background threads and complex state management
- **Maintainability**: Drastically reduced codebase complexity

## Next Potential Actions
1. **Release Preparation**: Finalize 0.2.0 breaking release with architectural improvements
2. **Feature Development**: Implement new MCP capabilities on simplified architecture  
3. **Documentation**: Update architectural documentation to reflect simplified design
4. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on core transport performance optimization

## Notes
- Architectural cleanup phase is now complete - all over-engineered modules have been removed
- airs-mcp is ready for either feature development or release preparation
- The simplified architecture provides a solid foundation for future development
- MCP stateless design principles are now fully implemented across all transport layers
