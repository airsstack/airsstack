# [TASK001] - JSON-RPC Foundation Implementation

**Status:** In Progress - DESIGN Phase  
**Added:** 2025-07-28  
**Updated:** 2025-07-28  

## Original Request
Implement base JSON-RPC 2.0 foundation for MCP implementation, focusing on message types, correlation management, and STDIO transport.

## Thought Process
Following the documented architecture in `crates/airs-mcp/docs/`, the JSON-RPC foundation belongs in `src/base/jsonrpc/` module. This is the foundational layer that all MCP functionality will build upon.

Key architectural decisions established during ANALYZE phase:
- **High Confidence Strategy**: 89% confidence score supports full implementation without PoC
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Both client and server can initiate requests
- **Type-Safe Message Handling**: Using serde for compile-time protocol compliance
- **Efficient Correlation Management**: DashMap for thread-safe concurrent operations
- **STDIO Transport Priority**: Primary interface for Claude Desktop integration
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-millisecond processing with >10,000 msg/sec throughput

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ANALYZE ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Define comprehensive requirements in EARS notation
- [x] Achieve 89% confidence score assessment
- [x] Document 26 structured requirements across 6 coverage areas
- [x] Establish acceptance criteria for all requirements
- [x] Validate implementation strategy (full implementation approved)

### Phase 2: DESIGN üéØ CURRENT
- [ ] Create technical architecture document in `spec/design.md`
- [ ] Define module structure for `src/base/jsonrpc/`
- [ ] Design core message type APIs
- [ ] Plan correlation manager architecture
- [ ] Design transport abstraction layer
- [ ] Create detailed implementation task breakdown

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENT ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Implement core JSON-RPC message types
- [ ] Create thread-safe correlation manager
- [ ] Build STDIO transport with tokio-util framing
- [ ] Add structured error handling with thiserror
- [ ] Implement request ID generation and management

### Phase 4: VALIDATE ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for all requirements
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks with criterion
- [ ] Validate sub-millisecond processing claims
- [ ] Test concurrent load handling (>10,000 msg/sec)

### Phase 5: REFLECT ‚è≥ PENDING

- [ ] Refactor for maintainability and performance
- [ ] Update documentation and examples

### Phase 6: HANDOFF ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Finalize API documentation
- [ ] Prepare foundation for MCP protocol layer
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-28 - ANALYZE Phase Completion
- ‚úÖ Completed comprehensive requirements analysis using EARS notation
- ‚úÖ Documented 26 structured requirements across 6 coverage areas:
  - Core Message Processing (6 requirements): REQ-001 through REQ-006
  - Bidirectional Communication (5 requirements): REQ-007 through REQ-011  
  - Transport Layer (4 requirements): REQ-012 through REQ-015
  - Performance (4 requirements): REQ-016 through REQ-019
  - Error Handling (4 requirements): REQ-020 through REQ-023
  - Edge Cases (3 requirements): REQ-024 through REQ-026
- ‚úÖ Achieved 89% confidence score based on:
  - JSON-RPC 2.0 specification clarity and established standards
  - Thorough project architecture documentation
  - Proven minimal dependency set
  - Specific, measurable performance requirements
  - Clear implementation path identified
- ‚úÖ Established full implementation strategy (no PoC required)
- ‚úÖ Created complete acceptance criteria for all requirements
- üéØ **NEXT**: Transition to DESIGN phase - create technical architecture document

### Decisions Made
- **Implementation Strategy**: Full implementation due to high confidence (89%)
- **Architecture Placement**: JSON-RPC foundation in `src/base/jsonrpc/` module
- **Performance Targets**: <1ms latency (99th percentile), >10,000 msg/sec throughput
- **Dependency Strategy**: Minimal set (tokio, serde, dashmap, thiserror, uuid, bytes, tokio-util, criterion)
- **Transport Priority**: STDIO transport as primary interface for Claude Desktop
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit tests + property-based testing + performance benchmarks

### Next Session Priorities
1. Begin DESIGN phase with technical architecture creation
2. Define detailed module structure for `src/base/jsonrpc/`
3. Create implementation task breakdown in `spec/tasks.md`
4. Plan public API design for message types and correlation manager
