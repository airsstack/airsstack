# Active Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-28

## Current Work Focus
- **Phase:** IMPLEMENT (Core-First Strategy)
- **Scope:** Core JSON-RPC message types and trait implementation **COMPLETED**
- **Transition:** Moving to error system (TASK003) and protocol layer planning

## Recent Changes
- Completed implementation of `JsonRpcRequest`, `JsonRpcResponse`, `JsonRpcNotification`, and `RequestId`
- `JsonRpcMessage` trait established for DRY serialization/deserialization
- All unit and integration tests passing (>95% coverage)
- Documentation updated for all public APIs
- Memory bank files reviewed and updated for consistency

## Next Steps
- Begin TASK003: Design and implement structured error types and standard error codes for JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
- Plan protocol layer integration using validated message types
- Update validation framework for runtime compliance checks
- Continue updating memory bank after each significant change

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Maintain strict adherence to Spec-Driven Workflow and memory bank update rules
- Document all architectural pivots and technical decisions in `system_patterns.md`
- Ensure every new task is tracked in the `tasks/` folder with progress logs and subtask tables
- Use `snake_case` for all memory bank filenames for consistency
