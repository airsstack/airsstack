# Use Cases & Application Scenarios

## **Development Workflow Enhancement**

### **Code Analysis & Generation**
```
User: "Analyze all TypeScript files in my src/ directory and identify potential performance issues"
AI Process:
1. list_directory("src/", recursive=true, filter="*.ts")
2. read_file() for each TypeScript file
3. Analyze code patterns and provide recommendations
4. write_file() to create performance-report.md with findings
```

### **Project Documentation**
```
User: "Create comprehensive API documentation by reading my OpenAPI spec"
AI Process:
1. read_file("api/openapi.yaml")
2. Parse specification and generate documentation
3. create_directory("docs/api/")
4. write_file() to create structured documentation files
```

### **Automated Refactoring**
```
User: "Convert all my React class components to functional components with hooks"
AI Process:
1. list_directory() to find React component files
2. read_file() for each component
3. Analyze and refactor code
4. write_file() to save updated components
```

## **Content & Asset Management**

### **Image Processing Workflows**
```
User: "Optimize all product images for web deployment"
AI Process:
1. list_directory("assets/products/", filter="*.jpg,*.png")
2. read_binary() for each image with processing options
3. Generate optimized versions and thumbnails
4. write_binary() to save processed images
```

### **Document Processing**
```
User: "Extract all text from PDF reports and create searchable markdown versions"
AI Process:
1. list_directory() to find PDF files
2. read_pdf_advanced() with text extraction
3. Convert to markdown format
4. write_file() to create searchable text versions
```

## **Project Organization & Management**

### **Intelligent File Organization**
```
User: "Organize my Downloads folder by file type and project relevance"
AI Process:
1. list_directory("~/Downloads/")
2. Analyze file types and content patterns
3. create_directory() for organized structure
4. move_file() to relocate files appropriately
```

### **Backup & Synchronization**
```
User: "Create a backup of my current project with only essential files"
AI Process:
1. Analyze project structure and identify essential files
2. create_directory() for backup location
3. copy_file() for selected files
4. Generate backup manifest and exclusion report
```
